J President Taft\nouded' the first of his forty-six\ndays of speech-making with au\naddress in. tho Auditorium hero\ntonight. Before arriving be bad spent\nnine hours in Syracuse.. N. Y., where he\nmade three speeches.\nTho president said he had determined\nthat his average during this trip would\nbo four and a half speeches a day, so\nhe did not start out at lop speed.\nMr. Taft reserved his most import\nant uttcrunco of the day for the speech\nhere when he outlined a plan by which\nho hopes to wipe out objections in tho\nUnited States senate to tho recently\nnegotiated treaties of arbitration with\nGreat Britain and France.\nThese treaties have been bold up and\nthreatened with defeat, largely because\nseveral senators have contended that\nthe proposed joint high commission\nwhich would determine whether or not\na question should bo scut to arbitra\ntion practically robbed tho sonato oi\nits function of passing upon the ques\ntion. Suggests Compromise.\nThe president tonight suggested as a\ncompromise 'tbtrtlTlii? American \"members\nof Hiich a joint; commission should bo\nconfirmed by tho senate. He said he\nsaw no reason why they should not be,\nif congress, or tho. senate, thought it\ndangerous to trust tlio president only\nto make the appointmeiita.\nMr. Taft indicated that he would go\nfurther than this and be willing to\nwipe out the joint \" high commission\nentirety, if need be, and loave.the de\ncision as to whothcr a question is ar\nbitral to a board of arbitration. Ho\nalso would be willing to havo this board\npass not only upon the merits of tho\nquestion, bur. upon tho jurisdiction.\n\"Either wo arc in favor of arbitra\ntion on issues which are likely to load\nijo war, or we aro not,'' ho exclaimed.\n\"Jf we aro in. favor of war as the\nonly means of settling questions of im\nportance betwoen countries, then lot us\nrecognize it as a principle, and decline\nall arbitration:, but if wo are really in\nfavor of arbitration as a- means of\navoiding war, then why should wc not\nbe willing to submit to impartial men\ntho decision upon a question mthor\nthan to lenvo it to the result of a\nbloody battle, in which, with a fair\ncause, we may be beaten or with an\nunjust cause wo may conquer?\"\nBiding His Time.\nThe president did not plunge direct\nly into a defonso of his administra\ntion, as some of his hearers had ex\npected. One of tho most significant\nthings he said was at tho luncheon\nwith tho New York state fair commis\nsioners at Syracuse, when ho explained\nwhy he had not discussed reciprocity\nin his outdoor address to several thou\nsands of city folk and farmors.\n\"I-am not going to speak about reci\nprocity,\" he said, \"until nfter the\nmatter is settled in Canada. We have\ndone \"our part and we aro waiting, and\nit is just as well for us to keep quiet.\"\nMr. Taft also explained in Syracuse\nwhy he happened to decide upon this\n13,000-mile jaunt to the Pacific and\nthrough \"tho enemy's countr.y\" of in\nsurgency. This trip was just like\n\"Tonsy,\" ho said; \"it .ist growod.\"\n\"Two years ago T promised Gover\nnor Hughes to visit your state fnir.\nThen I made an appointment with Con\ncrrcBsman Madison of Kansas to visit\nKansas and Hutchinson on tho semi\ncentennial of the state.\n\"These two engagement were the\nreason of my downfall. Thereafter an\nengagement in San Prnncisco accom\nplished by completo .ruin. Now 1 have\nbefore mo forty days of travel and T\ndo not know how many speeches, and\nI ask your prayers Tor my survival.\"\nExplains His Trip.\nIn further explanation of his trip, the\npresident said:'\n'T expect to talk on this trip about\ntho issues of the dav. and somo of my\npolicies if I may dignify my relation\nto them by the noiSPssive case and\ncount them among tho issues of the\nday. I hope I may he able tu bring i\nsomewhat more clearly from Uie stand\npoint of one who is charged with some\nresponsibility in respect of them, many\nof the questions that perplex the legis\nlators and executive at Washington.\"'\nAt the state fair grounds in l-yra-ciieo\nthe president found himself in tho\nmidst of one of the groa test crowds ever\ngathered there, and estimated by somo\nas in the neighborhood of 100,000.

It was for hours almost tho H\nsole topic oi: conversation about B\nthe streets and mightily stirred n\nthe authorities of the church. The ffi\nOrgan of the Mormon church last Jtim\nevening took account of the story H\nto the extent of devoting two B\npages of space to a discussion of\nthe details. B\nThe most important development of B\ntho day was thif identification, through H\nefforts pf a Tribune representative, oC Sj\ntho man who took tho views. JThis man It H\nis Gilbert L.

B\nWhile Bossard was employed for a B\nlong timo by Florence in His motion H\npicture business, it is said by close\nfriends of .\"Florence that Bossard took IB\nthe pictures on his own account and\nwithout the advico or knowledge oi H\nFlorence. -It was oulv after tho views (D\nh:fd boon obtained that Bossard told IB\nFlorence of his exploits, and the lat- H\nter, seeing an opportunity to turn them H\nto commercial account, investigated the S\nNew York markot with a view of dis- nl\nposing of them to postcard publishers V\nand stereopticon view manufacturer;! 9j\nshould the church refuse to buy tho M\nnegatives.

With the election less than u week\naway and the nominations all in, the re\nstill is really more in doubt than it has\nncn nt anv timo since the dissolution\nof parliament. The best opinion of iin\nbiased observers here is that Laurier\nwill win hut that his mu.iovity will be\nsliffhtly reduced. , ,\nBoth sides arc confident.

It Is said, while telling\nthe church ofTirlalH that everything was\nsat I is factory.\nHome months ago Bossard received p?r\nmluelon from Preslde'nt Joseph F. mlth\nto take a nunlbcr of view of tho In\nterior of tho Bee I live house. Ho said\nthat h desired to neiid the pictures to his\nrelotlvwt In Germany and that ho would\ni return the plates. The platen were not\nreturned nnd Chief of Police Barlow whs\ncalled Into the rase and Interviewed Bos\nsard at groat length.\nBossard frankly told the chief that he\n'cH great resentment against the church\nand that he nnt onK )nd taken pictures\nnf the Interior of the Bcr I live l-otlne. but\nthat h prtpcael to tak p'i lures of\neverything in the temple and expose what\nhe termed tho Iniquities of the church to\nthe world. Chief Barlow asked him how\nh expected to gain entrance to tho tem\nple and Bossard's roply was that that\nwas easy. .\nWants to Know Penalty.\nBossard also asked the chief what pen\nalty, if any, could be Imposed. In the\nevent that hoiobtalned tho views, adding\nthat he would' not break Into the build\ning, but that ho would gain entrance in\na perfectly legitimate wav. The chief\nreplied that ho did not know, but iid\nvlscd Bossard thgt ho stood an excellent\nchance of getting himself Into serious\ndifficulty. 9\n\"Well. (I will take a chance.\" was Bos\noard's reply. \"J can get In there nnd I\nwill take a lot of pictures that will ex\npose the iniquities of the church to the\nworld.\"\nThis conversation took place about six\nweeks ago and Bossard almost immedi\nately left town. At his former residence,\n38 North Seventh West street It was\nstated last night that he had gone to\nCalifornia.\nAt the time of Ihe conversation be\ntween Chief Barlow and Bossard the\nmatter of Bossard's ability to gain an\nentrance to the temple was gone. Into\nthoroughly by Chief Barlow and Charles\nH. Wllckcn. one of tho custodians of the\ntemple .grounds. The Investigation made\nat that time, taken In connection with\nthe developments of the last few days,\ncunvlnces Chief Barlow nnd Mr. Wllcken\nthat Bossard had the pictures In his pos\nsession at that time.\nRequired Nearly a Year.\nThat Bossard Is the man who look the\npictures also is Indicated In a statement\nmade to The Tribune yesterday bv a\nprominent citizen of Salt J,akc. who 'un\nexpectedly came Into close touch with the\nmatter. This Informant said to Tho\nTribune that tho taking of the pictures\noccupied tho time of the photographer\nfor nearly a year. It also was ndded that\nthe eight pictures sent to Joseph F.\nSmith, president of the Mormon church,\nby .Max Florence, were sixty short of\nthe number taken and that Included\" In the\nlist wero reproductions of marriage rec\nords,, minutes of Important meetings of\nthe quorum .of the twelve apostles and\nother secret data.\nAn Intimate of Max Florence makes\nthe statement that Florence had nothing\nwhatever to do with tho scheme of tak\ning the pictures, but that Bossard, after\nobtaining them, went to Florence, asked\nhim to finance tho proposition and\nturned the plates over to him.\nThere Is still talk of charging Max\nFlorence with attempted blackmail, but\nso far as Bossard is concerned, eminent\naLtorneys say that no charge can bo su\nstained against him, except probably a\ncharge of trespass, and that is so trivial\nthat It would not be pressed.\nDaniel Alexander, of the firm of\nStewart, Stewart & Alexander, who is\nmentioned In the letter of Florence, says\nthat he has done considerable legal work\nfor Mr. Florence In tho past, but that ho\nhas not been retained Jn the matter of\ntlie photographs.

H\nThe usual cause of Rheumatism is an excess of uric acid in the- ft\nblood which weakens and acidifies this vital fluid, and prevents the m\nproper amount of nourishment being afforded the muscles, nerves and jK\ntendons. The pains and aches of Rheumatism may be temporarily B\nrelieved by the use of liniments, hot applications, and other external m\ntreatments, but the disease cannot be permanently benefited by such H\nmeasures and is bound to become chronic and dangerous if , such things JS\nare depended upon alone. S.S.S. cures Rheumatism in the only way mm\nit is possible to cure the disease. It goes down into the blood, and re- Si\nmoves the uric acid from the circulation. When S.S.S. has cleansed MM\nand purified the blood the pains and aches cease, all inflammation dis- jftfl\nappears, and every symptom of Rheumatism passes away.

Edwards, editor of tho Man\nufacturers' Record, who was in the city\nrecently, says:\n\"The business situation in the south\nis probably better than irl any other part\nof the country. Ten years of greater ag\nricultural prosperity than that section\nhad known since 1S00 1ms enabled farm\ners to pay off hundreds of millions of In\ndebtedness, to improve their lands, to\ngive more attention to intensive cultiva\ntion, to increase the amount of fertilizers\nused from ?2,000,000 in 1900 to $74,700,000\nIn 1910. ajid to apond vast sums in build\ning new homes. In ten years the value\nof farm buildings in the sixteen southern\nstates increased SSOO.000,000,\nLast year's cotion crop, seed included,\nwas worth ?9G3,000.000, Though this year\npromises to be much larger, it may noc\nyield such an enormous money value to\nthe producers, but this difference will be\npartly counter-balanced by Improve\nments which will come to cotton mills,\ncottonseed oil mills and other interests\nthrough a larger supply of raw material.\nThough southern farm lands more than\ndoubled In value between 1900 and 1910,\nthe average value per acre Is only one\nhalf as much as for the whole country,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the south's\nleading crops yield a much greater value\nper acre than the wheat and corn of the\nwest. Last years cotion crop, for in\nstance, yielded over $30 per acre, while\ntho average value of wheat and corn per\nacre for the country was less than one\nhalf of that figure.\nWestern and eastern capitalists are in\nvesting heavily in southern properties, es\npecially large tracts of hind for coloniza\ntion purposes and overllowed lands for\ndrainage. Several million acres of wet\nlunds are now being drained In Florida,\nLouisiana. Texas and other states. These\nlands, when redralned, yield enormous\ncrops. The largest seed corn growing\nfirm in the United States bought 15.000\nacres of these lands In Louisiana and Is\nnow draining, preparing to grow seed\ncorn there.\nActivity in Eailway Building.\nAccording to census returns, the steam\nand electric railroads of the United\nStales purchased 1 18,231,000 crosstics\nduring the calendar year 1910, paying\ntherefor, at point of purchase, $75,589,000,\nas compared with 123,751.000 in 1909, 112,\n167,000 in 1908 and ir:;.703,000 in 1907.\ncosting $00,321,000. $50,282,000 and $7S.\n959,000. respectively. The number pur\nchased In 1910 was an Increase of 20 per\ncent over 1909. and 32 per cent over 190S.\nThese percentages indicate that the year\n1910 was one of the greatest years of ac\ntivity In railroad projection and construc\ntion, Of the totaTpurchases of crosstics\nduring 1910, 139,590,000. or 91.2 per cent,\nwere made by steam railroads, while\nelectric, railroads purchased S.G35.000, or\n5.8 per cent. Tho steady Increase In tho\nnumber of crosstics reported as pur\nchased for now track is noteworthy. The\ntotal for this purpose In 1910 was 22,\n255,000, as against 1C.-IC7.000 In 190S, 7,\n431.000 In 190S. by 199.5 per cent, and\nneujrly equaling that for 1907. the largest\nover recorded. Largely as a logical re\nsult -of the greater demand fro crosstics\nduring 1910 tho average cost per tie at\npoint of purchase advanced to 51 cents,\nthe same figure reached in 1907, as com\npared with -19 cents In 1909 and 50 cents\nin 1908.\nHail Production Increases.\nThe production or all kinds of rails\nIn the United Slates in 1910 amounted to\n3.fi3U.03l tons, against 3,023.815 tons in\n1909. an Increase of 612.1SU tons, or'oycr\n20.2 per rent. The maximum nroduction\nwas rouChcd in 190C, when 3.977.SS7 tons\nwere made. The year of next largest pro\nduction was 1910. Ralls rolled from pur\nchased blooms, eron ends, scran, seconds\nand re-rolled and renewed rails are in\nuludcd. ,\nExport Trade Increases.\nA statement issued recently by tho bu\nreau of statistics showing tho recent\nlaree Increase in the volume of our ex\nport trade in manufactures is hlgly sat\nisfartorv In connection with any consid\neration 'of the general foreign exchange\nsituation. It presents brlchL prospects of\nmaintaining a favorable international\ntrade balance. Fears of late have been\nexpressed in banking circles Dint In view\nof the Increased consuming capacity of\nour people -xport dado In the products\nof our farms, especially of foodstuffs,\nmust fevcrclv decline, and that, hi turn,\na point would gradually be reached at\nwhich w would ho compelled in a larce\nwav to pav cold for our imports. ,\nThe Increasing density of population in\nour farming districts, thu establishment\nof Industries In thnin. and the gradual\nmunicipality of the western sections must\ncraduallv reduce the area available for\nfarm pmlucta. whilo at the panic time\ntending to increase consumption. The\nincrease In area planted this year to\nwheat and corn indicates, of course, that\nthis point, has not been reached an a\nbroad proposition, but it must novertho\nh'ss be considered one of the problems\nor the very near future. James J. Hill,\nfor Instance, is convinced that it will not\nbo many venrs before we become a grain\nImportinc'ualiou.

(Copyright, .1911, by the Marquis ol'\nQueensberry.)\nCHICAGO, Sept. 3b'. This is my\nthirteenth day of journalism thirteen\nis my lucky number, and for the bene\nlit of other possible literary cubs, I\nwant to givo my experiences. Besides,\ntho moro cubs that come along the less\nof a cul) shall I bo mysolf, and tho ex\nperiences I have to rolato aro so pleas\nant that I sun suro many will want to\nemulate mo und embrace journalism us\na profession.\n1 am afraid X must apologizo lor my\nage, 43. It is rather lato to start at\nanything, but, strangely onough, my\nfather always said I -was a late colt,\nwho would not come till late in life.\nAnyway, up to now I have always beon\na listener, and having had a life of\none continuous round, of travel and ad\nventure, possibly some of The Tribtino\nreaders will benefit as I have by what\nI have learned in tho highways and by\nways of life and develop somo of the\nmild philosophy which has enabled me\nto bear a life of much sorrow and many\nvicissitudes of fortune with a smiling\nface and without losing my hair.\nAmericans Are Tolerant.\nTho thing that strikes me most in\nAmerica is the general tolerant spirit\nof everyone; no one seems to be preju\ndiced in any way, religious or social,\nand all men seem to bo listened to with\nan open mind and given a fair chauco\nin the open field,\nJ have felt a thrill which I have nev\ner felt before, this being absolutely my\nfirst start in journalism, and that is the\nthrill that appreciation gives, especial\nly as my boss has smiled on mc and\ntold me to go on and do better.\nAnother thing which strikes mo for\ncibly hero is the youth of the men con\nnected with the press giving it all the\nyoung, vigorous ideas, nnd it is most\nrefreshing. In 1113\" country you have to\nbe an old man, wear chin whiskers, and\nit used even to be necessary to wear\na stovepipe hat, before you could get\nanyone to listen to you.\nThis also applies to all the business\nmen I have met here; the young idea\nseems to predominate, and I am wound\nto say I think it is quite right. I\nhave often tried to force that, argu\nment' at home, but the older men hold .\nthe fort there and won't admit it; but\nit is bound to come, aud until it docs\nthe old world will lose many of its\nbrighter spirits, who enn't stand the\nheart breaking rebuffs that all origi\nnality meets.\nBritons Live By Rule.\nThey are very fond of tho word ec\ncentric at home, and anv one who does\nnot conform in every way to their an\ncient Roman customs, which aro tradi\ntions in public schools, passed on to\ntho universities, and accepted all\nthrough life as the standardized model,\nhas a rough time of it, from the sim\nple taboo to complete social ostracism.\nThe result is that many of our bright\nest, most foarless, and original men are\nnot appreciated till after their death,\nand then everyone cries out, \"How was\nit we never knew him?\" But here\nit seems to mo that the man gets his\nmerits during life, and what wo dub\neccentricity is here rather looked for\nthan squelched. i I always think for in\nstance and this point is a hobby of\nmine that no man should bo a judge\nafter the age of 55, as how cau a man\nas old as some of the judges arc in the\nOld World SO oven, and over for\none moment uuderstand the trials and\ntemptations of n young man, three gen\nerations younger'\nMy arguments are borne out in his-\nPILES\nQuickly\nCured\nInstant Relief, Permanent Dure Trial\nPackage Mailed Tree to All\nin Plain Wrapper.\nWe want every man and woman, suf\nfering from the oxcruciatiug torture of\npiles to just sotid their name and ad\ndress to us aud get' by return mail a\nfree trial package of th'c most effective\nand positive cure ever kuowu for this\ndisease, Pyramid Pile Cure.\nThe way to prove what this great\nremedy xvill do in your own case, is to\njust fill out free coupon and send to us\nand you will get by return mail a free\nsample of Pyramid Pile Cure.\nThen after you have proven to 3'our\nsolf what it can do, you will go to tho\ndruggist and get a 50 'cent box.\nDon't undergo an operation.

Since then -it\nhas been stated that tho supervision\nof tho Louvre has been very lax, and\nt hat many things have been stolen, but\nnothing of world-wide conscqucuco un\ntil now.\nIn so far as a parallel might be.\nfounrT between that theft and the in\nvasion of the privacy of ihu M'onnou\ntemple in Salt Lake, that parallel can\nbe drawn by any who wishes to do so,\nfrom ,the narration of facts in yestcr\ndny morning's Tribune. It appears to\nbo the truth, incredible as it mny ap\npear, that the temple privacy has been\ninvaded, and\" views of its inferior tak\nen xo as to. give a . pretty complete\nexhibit of all tho roomrf. The fact did\nnot seem to have been known to any\nono until tho possessor of the\" films had\nthe hardihood to write to the First\nPresidency here, offering them the first\nchance . to . buy what had been surrep\niiliously taken. The reply given was\nexactly what might have, been expect\ned, and what tho natural prdniplings\nof an' person or association so invad\ned, would make; tho church leaders\nwould decline io deal with thieves and\nblackmailers. Tf it did so dqal, it\nwould simply invite a repetition of\nihc burglary.\n. Tho atlompt to sell these views is\nevidently prompted by flic idea that\nthe church loaders, in order to pre\nserve tho secrecy of the inner sanctu-\narics, -would pay almost any price. The\nreply made, if adhered to.\" which will\nprobably bo the case, will dissipate that\nidea at once. And, indeed, there is\nno reason why the church leaders should\npay any groat amount of money, or\nany money at all, to suppress those\nviews. 4U is not in the least likely that\nanything is shown, or can be shown,\nthat would bo damaging in character.\nJust prior to the dedication of the tem\nple, large numbers of. the non-Mormons\nof this city were courteously per\nmitted to go through it. visiting every\nroom and portion without reserve.\nThose who accepted the courtesy ten\ndered, admired the finish, the paintings,\nthe adornments, and the furnishings,\nand were highly appreciative of the\nrichness and quality of it all.\nit appears, however, that the pic\ntures now offered were recently taken,\nand President Smith is able to identify\nabout the timo when thoy must have\nbeen taken, as much of the furniture\nis covered, as is usual in houscclcaning.\nWe aro glad to sec that the church au\nthorities resist this attempt of black\nmail, and do not believe that tho bur\nglars who entered the temple for their\ninischcvous -purposo will be able to\nmake much out of tho sale of tho pic\ntures. There is nothing sensational or\nunusual about. them, or about anything\nseen in the. temple, although ail is very\nappropriate, and the finishing and fur\nnishing are elaborate and beautiful.\nStifi, that sort of thing can be seen in\nmany religious edifices in all parts of\nthe world, and the demand s uot very\ngroat in any case.\nIt is well for the church authorities\nto refuse to be bled, and if will be a\ngood thing also if the purloiucrs of\nthese icws arc left in the lurch on\nthe expense account, and will not only\nhave their trouble for their pains, but\nwill lose money in tho bargain.\nTHE GOVERNORS ADJOURN.\nIt is a little laughable to read that\nthe Governors in annual convention at\nSpring Lake, New .lerscy, all at once\nfound that they had nothing to do. aud\nso adjourned. It is astonishing that tho\nmost ol them did not understand from\nthe first, that they had nothing to do,\nand that there was nothing for them to\ndo. First of all, only one, in tho whole\nlot was authorized by his State to act.\nfor it in arij' capacity what over. All\ntho others were thcro merely on their\ntitle of governor, without any author\nity lo do or to say anything, or in any\nway to represent their States. Prac\ntically nothing was done, aud of the\nchief thing which was taken up for al\nleged action hardly anything can be ex\npected to come. Wo refer huro to the\nprovisional action taken in regard to\nthe conflict on railroad rates in the\nMinnesota case, involving tho general\nquestion of the supremacy of the Fed\neral authority in interstate commerce\nwhen it conflicts with the Stato author\nity in a given case. The governors\ndeclared themselves in favor of mak\ning a fight for the State authority; but\nthoy are in no position lo make a fight,\nbeing in no sehbc a party to tho case,\nand it being practically impossible for\nthem lo get into it. Aud even if they\ncould get in. the prospect of success\nseems hopeless, since on all such ques\ntions Ihc tendency of the times unit t'so\ndecisions of the courts are uniformly in\nfavor of tho Federal jurisdiction. So\nstrongly is this manifested generally,\nUnit tho railroads thcmse.lves arc rapid\nly coming to the conclusion that the\nbest thing they can do is to submit\nthemselves entirely to Federal jurisdic\ntion in their interstate commcrco busi\nness; and a number of them aro ac\ntively socking Federal incorporation,\nthough Congress has as yet provided no\nmeans for granting it.\nBut it h rather laughable, after all,\nto see the suddenness with which 'the\ngovernors woke un to the fact that they\nhad nothing to do, and that, in effect,\ntheir convention was a mere assump\ntion with nothing -substantial to it. :uid.\nI its members with no authority, to do\nI anything at all.\nTHAT PARTISAN JOBBERY.\nWhen Lr. Job P. Lyon was defeated\nby \"tho gang'' for ronomination for\ncounty nliornc- of this county last\nyear, for opposing jobbery and graft,\nit was a foregone conclusion that\ntho suit to recover from the Smoot or\ngan, for its gTaft on Ihc publication of\ntho delinquent tax list would fail. It\nhas failed,' this by reason of th6 omis\nsion from tho plendi'ugs of the very\nthings that should havo been included\ntherein, and the absence of which tho\ncourt notes inits decision. With these\nincluded, as they could and should havo\nboon, it can fairly bo assumed I hat. tho\ncourt would havo come to a different\nconclusion.\nThe case is a very plain ne, Tho\nSmoot organ charged aud. collected\n$5727..j0 for the publication of that list,\nan amount which was considerably moro\nthan double tho amount which tho\ntreasury could collect and reimburse its\nfunds with on the same advertising ac\ncount. Undoubtedly the proper inter\npretation of tho law would limit tho\nmalvlinum 'charge for advertising to the\namount that the treasury could recover\nfrom . tho delinquents, which is 25 cents\npor description; but tho Smoot organ\ncharged - per inch, and so made tho\namount moro than double what it ought\nlo havo been. Besides this, the invi\ntation for bids as required by law was\nnot publicly made; tho wholo matter\nwas a partisan job put through without\ndie and lawful notice, aud without\ncompliance with the stntutcs. This is\nadmitted; but since tho pleadings were\nnot made perfect, tho court holds, while\nthe fact could easily have been shown\notherwise, that thoro was no collusiou\nshown, and that all concerned acted in\ngood faith; which they certainly did\nnot do.\nTho fact that the, basis upon which\nthis transaction was put through has\nbeen abandoned since, and was never\nthought of before, never considered as\npossible under tho law, is proof that\nnil concerned know they were conduct\ning this matter illegally. The practical\nresult of it was. that the property own\ners who paid their taxes were called\nupon lo pay, and did pay, more than\nhalf of tho ajiionnt paid for advertis\ning of delinquent taxes, this being\nsomething directly opposed to the plaiu\nintent of the law, and to commou hon\nesty; for when a property owner pays\nhis taxes, it is a clear imposition upon\nhim lo ask him to pay for the publica\ntion of other taxpayers' delinquencies.\nWhen a propcrt' owucr pays his taxes,\nthat ought to be, and iu contemplation\nof the law is, his full quittance for the\nyear. Bui the transaction put through\ncollusivclj' by the commissioners with\ntho Smoot organ compelled the taxpay\ners who were not. delinquent to pay for\nthose who were. The county treasurer,\nin place of being able lo collect from\nthoso delinquent in their tax the amount\nof .fCi727.uO which was paid for adver\ntising, was able to collocl only about\n$2300 under tho law, at 25 cents per\ndescription. The remainder had to bo\npaid by those who wore not. delinquent,\naud upon whom this collect ion was a\nfraud and outrage.\nThe cas was lost simply because it\nwas not earnestly prosecuted or prop\nerly handled. That is the plain fact\nabout it, and the taxpayers in this\ncounty were robbed of the amount\nstated, by tho collusive jobbery be\ntween tho county commissioners and j\nthe Smoot organ. It was a predatory\nraid upon the county treasury, impu\ndent, hra7.cn, and lawless- It is uot in\nthe least likely that any such a raid\nwas ever attempted before in an- coun\nty in the United States, and it is not\nlikely to bo repeated even here. The\nbasis upon which it was manipulated\nwas so clearly outside of tho law, aud\nso manifestly a robbery of the taxpay\ners who had paid, that, even the job\nbers themselves did not have the hardi\nhood lo proceed ou that basis the next\nyear.\nEXTENT OF SUFFRAGE.\nWe. arc asked to give our opinion on\ntho following question as stated:\nSuit Lake City. Sept. 13.\nEditor Trlbuno: Will you kindly Ivc\nyour opinion upon the following-.\nA claims thut In Staten where, woman\nsuffrage Is allowed fenmles have an ceiual\nright with males to votu for all State und\nmunicipal ofiicpnt. :ilso Tor Representa\ntives to Ihc United States Congress; but\nnot the right to vote for Presidential\nElectors, bceause the Constitution of Ihc\nUnited States does not mention remain\nvotPii? In connection with the manner of\nconduct In a Presidential olnellim.\nHe further argues that It Is an unfair\nadvantage for four or live State, with\nwoman suffrage, to be In a position to\npossibly change the result of a close Na\ntional election, which would have boon\notherwise with the femalo vote elim\ninated, and where mioh a contlgemy\nshould arise he contends It would he\ngood grounds for contest.\nOn \"tho other sddc, H contends that\ninasmuch as tho women are entitled to\nvoto for Congressional Representative?,\nnnd tho50 officials go to Washington and\nassist In making the general laws that\ngovern our country, there can be no doubt\nabout the National recognition of the. le\ngality of the women votes for Presiden\ntial Electors.\nHow doc:i It look to you? R.\nTo which our reply is. that B is cor\nrect so far as the practical fact, is con\ncerned. The woman vote in the;womcu\nsuffrage Stales on Presidential electors\njust as they do on Representatives in\nCongress, and on State, county, and\nmunicipal officers. When A holds that\ntho constitution of tho United Slates\ngoverns, ho is wrong so far as fixing\nan' qualifieaf ions for sttffragc is con\ncerned. There is no such thing as na\ntional suffrage; tho States regulate the\nsuffrage to suit themselves. Nor docs\nit follow, as' A seems to think, that\nit makes a difference in deciding a\nPresidential election whether tho wo\nmen voto or not. It is no injustice to\nany of the other States to have tho\nwomen vote for President; because tho\nState has just so manv (doctors, and tho\nwomen's vote does not inereaso this\nmuubcr at all. Ffah, for instance, in\nthe electoral college has had thrco\nvoles. This college is comprised of one\nelector for each Senator aud Bcpro\nionlativo from tho States' respectively.\nIn previous Presidential elections, for\ninstance, Utah, since Statehood, has\nhad threo electors. This number is uot.\nincreased by tho women votes. Utah\nwill havo at the Presidential election of\nnext year four electors, two on account\nof its Senators aud two for tho two\nrepresentatives .which it will havo in\ntho lower .house of Congress: Tho ap\nportionine.nl of Representatives is made\non the. aggrogato population of the\nStale, and not on tho number of votes\ncast. New York Stato at tho Presiden\ntial election of next year will have\nforty-fivo electoral votes, two ou ac\ncount of its two Senators, and forty\nthree on account of its forty-throo Rep\nresentatives, this being the number ac\ncorded to tho Stato on .the new appor\ntionment based on tho census of last\nyear. If New York should in the mean\ntime paas a law giving its women tho\nright of suffrage just an they have in\nUtah and other suffrage States, New\nYork would still have Its forty-five elec\ntoral votes, no more, no less; so that\nno injustice is done to any State by\nreason of any extensions or limitations\nof the suffrage which any Stale sees\nfit to impose.\nThcro is no National recognition of\nthe legality of women votes, just as\nthcro is no National qualification for\nvoters. Tho voters cast thoir ballots\nunder the Slate law, by virtue in each\nStato of the statutes passed governing\nelections. The National Government\nhas nothing whutevcr to do with it,\nsave thut the National constitution re\nquires Congress to guarantee to ovcry\nStato a republican form of government;\nand as long as Congress finds no reason\nto interfere on this account, tho States\narc Jeff; lo manage the matter entirely\nby and for themselves. It can hardly\nbe claimed that Ihc extension of tho\nsuffrage to women is a denial of a re\npublican form of government, and as\nlong as no such denial is cither claimed\nor can be insisted upon by reason of\nthat extension,-ihc Nntional authority\nhas no foundation upon which to act.\nTHE PRESIDENT'S TOUR.\nThe President.\" has begun his thirtcen\nthousand milo \"swing around the cir\ncle.\" Jlis itinerary is given as follows:\nLeave Beverly September 15; Syracuse,\nErie.

Mont., October 10.\nIt has been announced that he would\nspeak chiefly on the tariff question,\nwhich will probably be the case, since\nI here is no doubt that, on the whole, flic\nPresident has Ihc advantage in tho dif\nferences between himself and Congress\nj on the tariff bill? as passed, which he\nj vetoed. His position is a strong oue\non these, it being conceded ou all\nhands that he had tho advantago on\neverything except tho ' bill revising\nSchedule K, the wool tariff. On the\nfarmers' froo list, on the cotton, iron,\nand chemicals combined bill, it is im\npossible for any one to avoid the con\nclusion that the President was sound\nin his vetoes, and that he caught the\nCongressmen napping. But on tho wool\ntariff a contention is ntiido that the\nPresident was wrong, and that, the ar\ngument is with his opponents. This,\nhowever, loses sight of the fact that, in\nI ho computations made by Mr. Under\nwood, upon which he based his conces\nsions to La Follotlc as to the percent\nago of the tariff, a very serious error\nwas made in the basis\" assumed as ap\nplied to l ho prospoctivo revenue which\nthe United Slates would derive from\nwool imports. The difference was so\nserious, injuriously affecting the treas\nury, that the President made an irre\nsistible plea against the enactment of\ntho proposed bill.\nThe President's position throughout\nwas absolutely consistent, open, candid,\nand unqualified. He called the extra\nsession to act alono on the reciprocity\nagreement. He staled from tho first\nthat the tariff legislation should wait\ntho roport, oT tho tariff board. This\ntariff board had been directed by Con\ngress to roporl in December. T, was,\nas the President argued, unreasonable\nunder the circumstances lo undertake\ntariff legislation in the meantime, since\ntho progrannno for the roport of tho\nboard nnd for tho legislation which\nwould follow had been made up on a\ndifferent basis.\nAnd so the President will havo the\nargument with him, .save for tho ouo\npoint which the Democrats make, that j\ntho tariff on wool ought to bo reduced\nfor the relief of the people. In t-o far\nas tho Democrats can urge this as an\nanswer to what (ho President may say,\nits force will bo unbroken.\nThe President, it is also said, will\nspeak on I ho divorce, question, and\ndoubtlet-s he will take up various top\nics as they are suggested from time to\nlime, although for tho main pnrt his\nspeeches were practically outlined be\nfore he begnn his itinerary. Tho\n\" filIill:,, will be supplied from time\nto' time, and varied according- to tho\naudience nnd to the mood of Iho Pres\nident. It will bo a great trip from\nfirst to last, and the President can be\nassured of the. moat enthusiastic recep\ntion wherever ho appears..\nBUSINESS AND TRADE.\nAu important, event of the week just\nclosed was the oponing of the Bingham\nand Garfield Railroad for freight nnd\npassenger service, in addition to haul\ning tho ore from the mines at Bingham\nto tho smelter at Garfield.\nThcro has developed during Iho week\na diffcrenco of opinion between tho\nDenver & Rio Grando railroad and tho\ncoal dcalors. The dealers insist that,\ntho road has not suflicieut cars or mo\ntivo power to keep up tho coal supply,\nwhile tho company insists that it has,\nand that coal will be furnished in plen\nty for all demands. A good mnuy,\nhowever, wishing lo bo on tho safe side,\nnro putting in conl enough to give them\na good start for tho winter.\nAnnouncement was mado during tho\nweek that tho ucw Walker building,\nnortheast comer of Main and Second\nSouth, will be eixtocn stories, making it\ntho highest buildiug between Chicago\nand San Francisco. Work is progress\ning rapidly on tho Auorbutih depart\nment store, Third South aud State. Tho\nwork of finishing structures is in active\nprogress all over the city, and the year\nwill show a fine building record.\nTho construction of the new half-million\ndollar high school building on tho\nsoutheast bench is proceeding, with tho\nexcavation well under way.\nPlans for tho cupi.lol building havo\nbeen called for on Capitol hill, and tho\nwork is to be pushed with all possible\ndispatch. The hope that a building\nhigh enough to be seen will be con\nstructed, and that the capitol will not\nbo low and made to covor an immense\narea is generally expressed.\nTho administration building for tho\nUniversity will' be begun as soon as the\nregents can get everything in proper\nshape.\nTho demand for real estate is im\nproving, and residence property is in\ndemand for rental purposes.\nFall openings with merchants is the\nfeature of the retail trade.\nThat general business is good in this\ncity is evident from tho increase of 7.4\nper cent in the bank clearances tho\npast week compared with Ihc corres\nponding week last year.\nAgriculturally tho soason has been a\nvery successful one in Utah The yield\nis great, and the quality is high. Fruit\nespecially is the rago just now, and\nthere is plenty' of it of high grade.\nTho' coming Stato Fair it? attracting\nvory wide and deserved attention, aud\nit will undoubtedly bo the best ever\nheld in Utah.\nThcro was a streak of optimism that\nmanaged to find its way through the\nstock markot towards the eloso of tho\nweek, tho short interests begnn to cover\nand many of tho rails and industrials\nshowed marked gains before yester\nday's close.\nFor many months tho prices of Iho\nloading stocks havo boon on tho down\nward trend, all sorts of rumors being\nforthcoming to account for this. Thcro\naro many who bolievo that it wa-moro\nfear thou fact causing such timidity,\nand thoy arc inclined to believe that\nbusiness should expand as well as stock\nmarket prices. While any improvement\nshould bo slew and caroful, there aro\nthose who feel that the turn in the tide\nhas been reached.\nOf all branches of industry, the motal\nmarkets should rolled, any broadening\nout of business. Copper, lead, and zinc\nespecially occupy very strong -positions\nright now. Stocks of theso metals arc\nlimited, and prices for months, whilo\nquiet, havo held steadily. Utah gener\nally is in a very satisfactory position\nto benefit from increased metal prices.\nThcro wcro few .features during tho\nweek iu the local mining industry.\nBingham and Garfield were visited early\nin tho week, by Fmgiuccr J. Parke Clmn\nning, who gave a very optimistic in\nterview ou tho copper outlook, and wno\nplaced the seal of approval ou the ef\nficiency now' characterizing the Utah\nCopper mill operations. Mr. Chauuiug\nbelieves that higher-priced copper is as\nsurod in time, despite the increased pro\nduction 'of the so-called porphyry prop\nerties. Local mining stocks havo been very\nquiet. Featureless trading is experi\nenced from day to day. and it would\nscorn, in view of conditions, that slock\nprices have discounted nearly anything\nof adverse character that can develop\nduring the coming year.\nTho general commercial agencies of\ntho country report trade as slowly ex\npanding, but on a conservative basis.\nTho uncertainty in prices retards or\nders in tho iron and steel trade, aud\ncompetition is becoming pronounced,\nwith price-cutting iu the steel bar\ntrade, aud plates, sheets, and wire\nproducts.

Stop and consider what it means,\nB Think pf it ladies, its the foundation of health, comfort arid appearance and the beauty of it\nis all three combined can be readily given when you put yourself in the hands of an expert\nHi corsetier.\nj When properly corseted one can always be well gowned. Your dressmaker or tailor can-\nnot give you the graceful and stylish lines unless properly corseted. Your corset is what\nmoulds your figure and shows your gown off to best advantage. ' ,\nTho first lines to grace is to appear thoroughly comfortable Your cor\n' set should bo so well fitted and strike every line of your figure so correctly-\nthat you aro absolutely comfortable. '\nNo matter how stout the lady may be, it is not necessary to wear a\nheavy corset, it is not the weight that holds the figure in place, it's tho cut,\nand that cut must be suitable to the figure.\nr j c'orBetB like everything elso changes according to tho different styles and\nfads which makes it all the more necessary to understand what model to givo\nand what alterations to make in ordo r to give a stylish and up-to-date figure\nand at tho sarao time comfort.\ny- Corsetry Is an individual study. An export coraoticr Ib ono who has giv-\nfm en a long timo in study. She has to bo thoroughly well versed before sao at-\naM tempts to fit a lady to a corset. HER.

There arc more members of the church\nusing English as their natlvo tongue\nthan any other lanfruarc and it seems\ncurious that this preat maB should have\nonly one representative among1 the princes\nof the church. It adda force to the feel\ning that at tho next consistory which I\nunderstand will be held next month at\nleast one additional American cardinal\nshould be created.\nForty new summer conferences Is tho\nextraordinary record of a conference sea\nson Just closed. These new outing places,\nalmost wholly religious, arc scattered\nthroughout the middle west and the\nsouth, with only a very few in New\nEncland.\nStrange to say, tho unusual number\ndoes not indicate a great turn-out of poo\nple to summer conferences, although most\nof them have started, well.

Missions, the Bible,\nsocial service, mothods of work, Sunday\nBChool and evangelism have been the\nthemes.\nRoman Catholics as well as Protestants\nhave started theso new outdoor religious\ncenters. Jesuit priests being particularly\nactive in co-operation with laymen. Both\nhere and lu Europe both Jesuits and Ro\nman Catholic laymen arc working to\ngether. The new House of Retreat, on\nStaten island, is pointed to as a type\nof what Roman Catholic churchmen arc\ndoing In many states as well as abroad.\nOrganjzatlons bringing into existence this\ngroat number of new summer confer\nences Include the Laymen\"s Missionary\nMovement, the Christian Endeavor, the\nBrotherhood of St. Andrew, the Sunday\nSchool association, the Chautauqua' move\nment and especially the clerical clubs.\nThe last named are engaged In efforts to\nInform ministers on missions.\nForeign Missions Make Gain.\nThe Methodist foreign mission board,\nrepresenting the large Methodist body\nof the north.

This is not. however, an excep\ntional gain, Bince it has several times\nduring the pust decade increased its an\nnual 'receipts by that um or a larger\none. However, it is encouraged at this\ntirno because two years ago it fell Into\ndebt $175,000. Last year it got out to\nthe extent of .$70,000, but still had a debt\nat the beginning of this year of $08,000\nThe foreign bonrd asks Methodists for\n$1,500,000 and promised to the mission\nfield this year $1.11-1,000. Last year\nMethodists gave, through their regular\nhoard, $1, 123.000 to foreign missions,\nwhile Methodist women gave, through\ntheir foreign board. $705,000, a total of\nmore than $2,100,000. The women raise\nand spend money for missions, adminis\ntering their affairs without turning\nmoney over as in the case of most oth\ners, to tho men's societies.\nThis year both home and foreign\nMethodist board? hold their annual\nmeetings in Denver.

JG. It is a fright\nful task vrhieh William Howard Taft\nlias set for himself. Tlicro is a tragic\nstory in the children's books about the.\nmouse that Marled valiantly to ear. his\nway throuch aheeso. Mr. Taft started\n(o eat his vrny across tho continent and\nback aeain. A statistician at. the Union\nclub last night bcunn to figure up tho\nnumber of half-shollcd bivalves which\nwould be put before the president before\nhe sees the White House at the end ol\nthe trip, but abandoned the count in\nquite a hopeless maze, of clammy nirures.\nPools arc boinjr niado in New ork Uty\nupon his weight. Yidicn he returns n\nproblem which, to some, would seem far\nsimpler if the element ol worry did\nnot count ho much in such nm.ttors. It\nwould be comparatively easy to nguro\nout the fato a man might take upon\nhimself, given as a basis lor tho cal\nculation his disposition and the ban\nquets he must eonsnnio if there was\nnothingyto offset the food. Hut in this\ncase there is something. There is La.\nFollette. .\nSeo Fatality in Figures.\nOut at the Spring Lake meeting thero\nwere thirteen Republican governors.\nOminous figures for tho party, by the\nway, and, moreover. President Lntl, be\ngan his tour on Friday, and it is to cov\ner 13,000 miles. A newspaper man s\nstudy of the thirteen governors result\ned in the calm announcement that\nthey were evenly divided between latt\nand La Follettc and this report was tel\negraphed throughout the country. It\nwould take King Herod to divide t hir\nteen governors equally between two\npresidential aspirants and tho process\nwould completely spoil one governor,\nbut no enthusiusilic straw vole nrtisc\nminds a little thing like that. It seems\nto be tho fact, however, that more than\none political expert was astonished bv\nthe strength which the Wisconsin man\ndovolopcd there among tho governors.\nHis most outspoken advocates wore .uo\nGovcm of Wisconsin, who, ol course,\nwould wish to boom home industry; a\nrey of Wvoming; 'Vcsey of boutli Da\n.kota: Stubbs of Kansas and Aldnch\nof Nebraska. .\nIf is reported by the insurgent syin-1\npnthizcr. there is a black cat ou the\npresidential car.\nQuestions to Be Asked.\nNew York opinion is divided as to\nthe real importance of the insurgent\nmovement which, at tho present tunc,\nseems to have crystalled its hopes m\na list of questions which the president\nis to be asked to answer in the strong\nholds of insurgency. These question\nirWhy did vou hurry a reduction of\nthe duties on agricultural products\nthrough a special session of congress\nand still compel the people to wait for\na revision of the wool schedule 7\nDo you favor the central bank plan?\nWhat is your policy toward Alaska?\nWhat new trust legislation shall you\nadvocate? , , ,,\nWhat will be your policy toward the\nprogressives in the party if you are\nnominated aud elected? ...\nThe progressive bureau ,in Washing\nton believes these questions will tre\nmendously confuse tho president.\nThere are others than himself who\ndiscredit this political forecast, re\nfusing to be worried over his ability\nto answer to the general satisfaction\nof the country tho insurgent list of\nquestions.\nAnd that Mr. Taft himself doos not\nfollow tho insurgent lino of reasoning\nas to which states arc doubtful is in\ndicated by the fact that his great tour\ngives scant attention to New York\nstate and New England, and does not\ngo at all to either Indiana or Ohio.\nProjjrcssives Hopeful.\nBut the progressives arc verj- hope\nful, having just boon assured of what\nthe.v consider very strong support t by\nRudolph Spreckles, the sugar million\naire reformer of San Francisco. He\naud Medill MeCorinick, Chicago's fa\nmous oditor. who is so definitely a mem\nber of tho progressive movement that\nho took charge of the Washington i\nheadquarters; for a time roccntly, spent\nmuch tnne together during theVeek. j\nMr. Sjprcckles predicts freely that tho\nCalif onia delogaliou to tho Republican\nconvention will be solidlv for; La Fol\nlettc. And if the progressives arc now\nfighting in the open, Mr. Taft has pre\npared copiously to meet their opnosi- ,\ntion. It is definitely stated by those '\nin a position really to know, that the I\ntwo hundred odd speeches ho has pre-1\npared wholly or in art give almost j\nas much auontion to the progressive !\nmovement as they do to the Democracv.\nHe has, however, kept prcttv carefully,\nunder his own hat the line of talk\nwhich he will follow. It is only known i\nthat he will answer the insurgent ques\ntions very fully and with emphasis,,\nand he will dub those insurgents who '\nsupported the Democrats in congress i\non the tnrii? measures open traitors\nto the Republican party, that he will;!\ndiscuss reciprocity nt length, arguin\"-.\nthat it would1 help, not hurt, tho farm-1\ncr. and that he will urge, conservation\nand currency reform continually.\n1 have given more attention\" to tho\npresident than to the governors.

If any very bitter and in the,\nleast nuFtifinblo disappointment over,\nthe conference work exists in nnv\nminds, it is undoubtedly in those of the\nnational divorce law advocates. It is\ntho belief of mnny of the .governors\nthat at the next session this will bo the1\nburning question.

Sept. 1G The flood of trav\nel still sweeps westward In pracllcally\nunatated volume. Thc labor troubles and\ntho consequent disarrangement of ship\nping schedules caused a great congestion\nof homeward bound Americans which has\nnot yet been fully relieved. Every west\nward bound passenger steamer Is crushed\nto Its limit and It will be some weeks\nyet before this travelers from beyond the\nsea will be taken home.\nAll passenger records have been broken\nfor the past month. In one week just\nafter tho strike was settled fully 50.000\npassengers left England for home. This\nonly Includes Americans, not taking Into\nconsideration thc great volume of emi\ngrant traffic.\nIt would be Impossible even lo esti\nmate the wealth left in Europe this year\nby traveling Americans. That ll. runs\naway up In the mlllolns, pounds, not dol\nlars, Ip certain. It Is certain that It tops\nall previous records.\nThc two dominant figures in the re\ncent labor troubles on the side of thc\nmen were Tom Mann and Ben Tillett.\nThey arc perhaps the most Influential\nmen in England today In the ranks of or\nganized labor.\nLabor Leaders -Had Eventful Careers.\nIt Is a curious fact that they both\nhave been rolling stones whose lives\nwould furnish plenty of material for af\nfection. Few men have had a more strenuous\nstruggle for existence than Tillett, who\nIs general secretary of the Dockers'\nunion. As a boy he traveled the country\nwith a circus troupe, afterwards being\nsent to work In a brickyard. At 12 years\nof age ho was onc of the crew of a fish\ning smack. Then he was apprenticed lo\na bootmaker, served for some lime ln the\nnavy, and after helng Invalided Horn the\nservice, and making some voyages In\nmerchant, vessels, settled down to labor\norganizations. He organized the Dockers'\nunion and his interferences with foreign\nstrikes have not been relished by Bel\ngian or German authorities, who Impris\noned him and ejected him from their\nterritories.\nTom Mann, tho strikers' general, was\nborn at Folcshill. \"Warwickshire, where\nhe worked In the coal pits as a boy.

Truly an avail\ning story , if unpreventable, but all the\nmore ghastly when it is realized that\nthis tremendous toll of human life, of\nsuffering, of misery nnd privation might\nhave been lessened .by one-half, had the\nproper precautions been taken in time.\nHow tp reduce this loss to the min\nimum is t he problem now being consid\nercd by the Bureau of Mines, and as a\nstriking object lesson a great national\nmine safety demonstration will be held\nin Pittsburg, Pa., October 26-27, under\nthe auspices of this bureau, the Amer\nican Red Cross, the United Mine Work\ners of America, and the Pitsburg coal\noperators' nsocintion. From 30.000 to\n50,000 (miners, superintendents and oper\nators ere expected to bo present.\nPresident Taft Secretary Fisher and\nother notables will attend this meeting,\nas well aa prominent men from all over\nthe United States. The purpose is to\ndemonstrate strikingly and convincingly\nthe possibility of cutting the mine death\nrate in two, as well as effecting the\nsaving of millions in property loss. The\nUnited States is still a now' country in\nmining, ami has still to learn some of\nthe fundamental safeguards thnt, have\ncome io the older mining countries\nthrough bitter experience.\nJ'\"or example, it has .been generally\nbelieved by both coal minors and oper\nators that coal dust could not explode\nwithout the presence of gas. The bu\nreau of Mines has demonstrated .beyond\nany possible doubt that bituminou-Tconl\ndust alone it more of a menace to tho\nminer than fire damp, f'oal dust has\nboon the causo of a big majority of the\nmysterious explosions in . coal mines in\nthe las: few years, and the Bureau of\nMines will demonstrate this beyond\nquestion at the Pittsburg meeting.\" On\nthe 26th there will be an actual ex\nplosion of coal dust in the experiment\nmine belonging to the bureau, where\ncondiiions similar to all coal mines arc\nto bo found.

As a rule, when a miner is in\njured he is far in the mine. A. fnctory\nworkman can be quickly rushed to the\nhospital, but the miner may have to\nbe hulf-cnrried or dragged on a rude,\nstretcher for a mile or more underground\nbefore the trip to the hospital starts.

A short stop will\nbo made at Morgan \"where preparations\naro being made forthc new hotel and\nresort, that arc to make the Morgan\nvalley famous. I21mcr O. Brain; general\nmanager for this corporation which was\nformed a few days ago, is now at Mor\ngan superintending the construction of\nthe power plant and making prepara\ntions fbr the construction of the hotel.\nThat the new hotel will be construc\nted mainly of a line building stono thnt\nhas been found within about two miles\nof the site of the hotel, is the latest\ndevelopment regarding it. This build\ning stone, which, like the coal beds,\nlime rock and brick clay, have lain un\ndisturbed in i,hc peaceful little valley,\nwill be on exhibit at the state fair this\nfall. The alley has been noted for iU\ntgctnbles, it being haid that peas, po\nlatne- and caulillower arc raised hero\nhow to administer first aid. It is be\nlieved that the actual seeing of these ex\nplosions by the minors will give them\na new sense of their responsibility as to\ntheir dangers, while the first-aid con\ntests and demonstrations must bo of\ngreat educational value.\nLong before the Bureau of Mines en\ntered the field, the American Red Cross\nhad been at work. Tts efforts havo thus\nfar been confined to tho Pennsylvania\nanthracite fields, and as a result, this\nregion is acknowledged to be far in ad\nvance of an' other mining section in\nthis country, because of t Tic effective\nfirst-aid instruction given by this so\nciety. Contests will also be held, between\nsufficient to suppl' 130,000 people every\nyear. 1\nA plan io cut through from City\nCreek canyon to Uaidscrabble canyon, J\nmaking an automobile road of just\ntwenty-six miles from Salt Lake City j\nto the hotel, all the way through a\nbeautiful canyon, is now much in favor.\nThis plan has beeu considered for some\ntime by the good roads committee and\nit is thought that it can bo carried out\nfor about $10,000.\nBesides the president, of tho corpor\nation, M. j.

The following Interesting discussion of\nthe present industrial Ills of tho nation,\nend suggestions for relief, are had IiV' the\nlost weeic's market letter of James A.\nrollock & Co.:\nThe general securities markets show\ncontinued weakness, but after such a\nlong and drastic decline tho downward\nsymptoms should soon disappear and a\nmoderalo recovery sot lnt Unauestlpn\n0 ably thoro has been a great dual of what\n. Is termed \"scientific selling,\" and appar\nently It has been more of a liquidating\nmarket than a bear market, but there Is\njcottlng to bo a little too much company\non tho selling side to suit up. The\npendulum of prices swings both Tvays\neven In times of. depression.\nThe business of the country Is at a\nstandstill on account- of lack of confidence\nin the future. \"Enterprise has ceased and\nno one will undertake anything now. Tho\nmanufacturers, builders and railroads re\nfuso to go ahead with their ordinary busl\nPfl ireas In tho way of buylnp supplies. That\nPPI -which la absolutely necessary- Is pur-\nPR chased and no more. If this condition\ncontinues tho arteries of trade will suffer\nfrom paralysis and dry rot. The root of\nthe evil Is lack of confidence brought\nabout, by the attempt of theoratlcal law\nmakers \" to make rules and regulations\ntfor the conduct of business conditions\nJthat arc twenty years ahead of their\n'Ideas. The great business men and tho\nIndustries they represent have for years\nbeen assailed by government and politi\ncians, and this has been duo to the fact\nthat tho latter have heen so far behind\nthe business band wagon that they could\nnot keep In step with tho march of pros\nfcess. Results Are Seen.\nTho obstacles of ignorance and preju\ndice havo brought the Inevitable and just\nreward In the evidence now all too ap\nparent of the coming slowing down of\nthe groat engines of Industry. Tho gen\neral business of tho country Is becoming\ndepressed and surely will not again he\ncome active while the great enterprises\nof the country languish. There will be\nno chango In conditions until tho pcoplo\nof the country awake to the fnet that\nthey have been following false lenders and\nproceed to place tho brand of disapproval\nupon political demagogues. It ,1s the groat\nenergy and Industry 6f the business mon\nof- the country that has made It the com\nmercial wonder of the nations of .tho\nworld, and not the politicians. What\nbenefit will tho country derive If It suc\nf'Cnds Id driving out -of it severnl hundred\nmultl-mllHonalres with their masterly\nabilities? Surely there Is not another\ncountry on th- globe that will not wel\ncome them with their brains and money.\nThe people may be forced to make a\nchoice between the politicians who live\nupon them and the great captains of in\ndustry. who furnish the basis of prosperity\nand livelihood for all. The shadow of the\n1 bread lino will probably hasten the dc-\nclblon. Capital has been harassed until\nIt has become timid, but we hope and\nliejlcv this Is but a temporary condition\nand that tho sphlt of fair play and great\ncctroge thai bus vitalized the commercial\nlift; of this great America\" still exists and\nj that common sense win again prevail.\nThere are grievances to be adjusted and\nevils to be eradicated, and tho quicker the\nthinking people of the country take up\nthe work of educating the masses and\nbllenclng the demagogues the sooner will\nthe business of tho cpuntry return to a\nnormal activity.\nLogical Remedy.\nThe first .thing to do Is to put the\nquietus on tho legal parasites who live\nupon the fortunes and misfortunes of the\npublic. About OO per cent of our con\ngressional representatives are lawyers or\nprofessional men. If tho voters of the\ncountry will retire about SO per cent of\nthis class and fill their places with an\nequal number of business and working\nmen wo will probably get a few sane laws\nplaced upon the statute books for the\nconduct of commercial business. The\nlaws should \"he so simple -that there will\nbe no reason for misunderstanding, and\nthey should be made not only to control\nbut to protect the business Interests.\nI NEW PRESIDENT OF\nHUMBOLDT CON.\nVr, -H.

During the\nmonth a new shaft, known as No. 150.\nwas started In thu southwestern portion\nof the company's territory. In this sec\ntion, which is located adjacent to tho\nSavago mine of the McKInley-Darrngh,\nsummer prospecting baa met with quite\nencouraging results and several cnlclto\nveins of more or less promise havo al\nready boon opened.

Drift\ning here has been carried on for 120\nfeot over tho entire distance, tho vein\naveraging one Inch In width and carry\ning from 1209 to 1500 ounces per ton.\nPlans are now being prepared for the\nerection of a central jigging plant at the\nNlplssing property, to be located at shaft\nNo. 73, which will receive all of the ore\nfrom the various shafts situated In the\narea adjacent to tho town of Cobalt.\nDuring tho month approximately 8000\nfeet of trenching was done, most of which\nwork was confined to a diabase forma\ntion. This work, however, disclosed no\nnow veins. I\nLa Eoso Operations, .\nOperating- profits for La Hose Mines,\nLtd,, for tho month of July amounted to\n$105,121. During tho period (here were\nproduced 320,823 ounces of silver, having\na sross? value of S171.S30.

La\nRose is on an 8 per cent dividend basis,\nwhich calls for earnings of SHO.OOO per\nmonth.

Tho landB found to contain work\nable coal beds aggregated 1G.S73..370 acres.\nThese lands, In 10-acrc tracts, have been\nappraised by the survey at a total valua\ntion of 711.093.537, In prices ranging\nfrom the minimum figurd stated in the\ncoal law S10 or$20 an acre, according\nto whether the land is located within\nfifteen miles of the railroad to figures\nof over $-100 an aero where the thickness\nof the coal beds may aggregate (JO, 80,\nor 100 feet, or even more.\nTho government valuations accord In a\ngeneral-way with the market values of\nprivate coal lands In the west, although\nas a matter of fact they aro somewhat\nmore liberal to tho purchaser. Four hun\ndred, dollars an acre may seem a high\nprice for Undo Sam's coal land, which\na few years ago might have 'been bought,\nfor $20 an acre. However, the geological\nsurvey's plan of claaslllcallon and valua\ntion contemplates that the government\nshould receive at least a reasonable re\nturn for Its coal, admittedly the most\nuseful rock mineral In Its possession.\nWhen it Is understood that an aero\nwith, say, a 40-foot coal bed or seam,\ncontains approximately 72,000 tons of\ncoal and an acre with 100 feet of coal\ncontains 160,000 tons, the price asked by\nthe government, instead of being exorbi\ntant, Hueins, on the other hand, hardly\nsufficient.. On land having a thickness\nof SO feet of coal 5100 an acre would be\nless than 3 cents a ion. In reality, un\nder the survey regulations which con\nsider depth of the coal, number of beds,\nquality, nnd other physical details, the\nprices asked for many areas containing\n80 feet of coal arc equivalent to nearer\ni than 3 cents a ton.\nAt the minimum prices which were in\neffect before the government \"withdrawals\nof coal lands, tho 16.S73.370 acres above\nreferred to would havo been priced at\nonly\" L'6C.652,'iSl, the difference In favor\nof tho public revenue at tho new prices\nbeing therefore $415,310,106.

Advices as to the\nstate of trade denote slight Improvement\nand more confidence, 'but the conservat\nism which has been in evidence for quite\na period seemingly has dictated a hand-to-mouth\npolicy on the part of retailers\nand In addition collections are reported\nas being slow.\nCompetition in iron and steel lines has\nbecome rather keen and rjrlce cutting on\nfinished products on a larger scale has\nbeen Indulged In.

Every store has made big propa-\nB rations for tire.\" event, and from now to\nChristmas will have all tho business\nB thev can-handle.\nL Salt Lake buyers have all returned\nB from tho Eastern markets and the\nB clerical forces of tho stores have been\nH busv unpacking, marking and placing\n'the merchandise on the shelves.

C. Stay, connty\nhorticultural inspector: and yesterday\nthere, wore 1500 persons there to buy\nat retail. , , r\n\"Each person who goes to the mnr\nket and gets goods cheaper tljan a . t he\nretail stores.\" says Mr. btay. ' 'tells\nhia or her neighbors about it, with the\nresult that, the market is constants\ngrowing. I believe that, if it is allowed\nto continue, the street market will be\nturned into a retail market within i.\nmonths. , ....\n\"Even as it is now. the person with\na large family to provide, for, or the\nman who is laying in a winter supply\nof vegotabloF, finds that he can effee t ft\nconsiderable saving by attending the\nmarket. \"And thus the middlemen\ncommission men and retailers are be\ning cut out of the traffic to a consider\nable oxtont, to such an extent. I believe,\nindeed, that it is liable to malce the win\nter dull in some of the retail stores.\nBig Demand for Peaches.\nPeaches were the feature on the local\nmarkot yesterday, and Mr. Stay esti\nmates thnt there were close to\nSOOO cases for sale, at prices ranging\nfrom forty cents to sixty cents. Tho\nprico he considers abnormally low con\nsidering the comparatively scant supply\nof poaches that aro in the country.\n\" I believe,\" he naid. \"that the price\nof sugar lui3 much lo do with this, and\nthat tho people do not care to put up\ntheir usual supply with sugnr worth\nwhat it is today.\n\"I i;an say, though, that I think that\nwhen you can get poaches of the 'four\nsix' size for sixty cents a case, or loss,\nthat it is cheap. Tho present is about\nthe height of the peach season.\"\nSomething of the size of the supply\non hand. i5000 cases, can be gained\nfrom computing that it means more than\nthree full carloads of peaches. The 1,\n500 retail buyers had considerable\nchoico to pick from at that.\n\"T uevcr saw the market looking\ncleaner or prettier,' ' said Mr. Stay, in\nroferring to tho quality of the goods on\ntho market this morning. By \"clean\ner\" Mr. Stay refers to freodom from\ndisoaso or infection.\nApples Condemned.\nMr. Stay yesterdaj condemned four\nteen bushels of apples that had the\ncodling moth, but they wero not on the\nstreet, market. They had teen shipped\nto a local commission house from He-1\nbor Jensou, of Hyrum. t\nJonathan apples have made their ap\npearance on the market. Tn addition\nto the large supply of peaches j'ester\nda3 thore were about 300 bushels of\napples, 200 bushols of Bartlett pears,\nselling ot $1.50 a bushel for good clean\npears; prunes nfc $1, this being about the\nbest season for pears and prunes, us\nwell as peaches.\nThis week Utah grapes will be on the\nmarket, and probably will be found\nsweeter than tlie California variety\nthat has been marketed here.\nBUILDING PERMITS\nFOR WEEK SMALL\nBuilding permits aggregating $38,800\nwere issued during the week by Build\ning Inspector A.

They point out\n1 the defects of the Salt Lako commis\nsi sion form of government -which they\nH- show was adopted not for the purpose\nof reforming the city rovernmcnt, but\nfor the purpose of again placing Salt\nLnkc under church control.\nPersonnel of Committee.\nB The committee, which prepared the\nH, address, is composed of D. 0. Dunbar,\nH, president of tho American club: P. E.\n- Connor, secretary of the American\nB'i elub; J. E. Paniier, A. J. \"Weber, Dr.\n0. I Douglas, S. P. Armstrong and\nMM Col. Matt Dangherty. The address fol-\njl lows:\nH' Pursuant to the action of the. American\nclub, at tlie meeting held September IS,\nmm 19J1, tho committee appointed to. prepare\nIan address to the voters of the city pre\npcnts the following In addition to the\ndeclaration of principles adopted at that\nBelieving that the perpetuation of the\nAmerican party la absolutely noco3sary\nfoi- tho welfare and prosperity of this city\nand state, we therefore advise and advo\neato the Indorsement of Americans by\nan American party convention, to bo\n-. - voted for at tho primary election to he\nhold under the commission form of gov\nernment on Tuesday, tho 2-ILh day of\nOctober. 1911.\nWe heartily Indorse tho nctlon of the\ncity committee In calling such conven\ntion that we may have concerted action\nof Americans at the primary election. In\norder that the people may have an oppor\ntunity to vote for Americans at the city\nelection.\nWe lake this position for tho following\nreasons:\nFirst Because the commission form of\ngovernment -was enacted for tho purpose\nof destroying the American party and re\nturning the Mormon hierarchy to power.\nSecond Becauso the commission form\nof srovernmont has boon forced upon the\npeople without opportunity for approval\n. or dissent.\ns Third Because It must bo presumed\nmm that the legislature Intended to penult\nparty nctlon In supporting candidates ut\n' the primary election, since it omitted all\nH provisions adopted by other states pro-\n. hiblllng such party action.\nB Onc-Sidcd Measure.\nFourth Because there Is no provision\nfor civil service examination of employees\nby which thoy may he selected on the\nbnsls of illness and qualification, as pro\nvlned by the laws of other states having\nthe commission form of government.\nFifth Because there Is no provision\nj to prevent city employees from combining\nin a political machine to pcrpctuato In\npower those who have been elected to\noffice.\nSixth Because there Is\" no provision\nt for the recall of undesirable, unfaithful\nor dishonest officials.\nm Seventh Because there is no provision\nfor the submission to the people of fran\nchlse or other questions by initiative or\nmM referendum, as has been provided by\nother states when the system has been\nadopted. Under the present law a ma\njorlty of tbe commission (three men) may\nbarter or give away franchises of great\nvalue and tho people be absolutely wlth\nout power of redress from the burdenH\nimposed.\nEighth Because tliere is no provision\nby which the city can repudiate the com-\nm mission in case It 1 found impracticable\nor Inadequate to administer the govcrn-\nH. moot of the city.\nH, Ninth Because officials selected inric-\npendent of party uct.lon are bound by no\nmM platform, proclaim no policy, and arc\nmM answerable for their actions only to the\nmm Felf-appolnted few who assume to name\ncandidates for all the people.\nB-- Must Keep Freedom. -\nWe submit to every thoughtful citizen\nm that only. by eternal vigilance and unceas-\nlnp activity of the American party can\ntho people of this state hope to escape\nthe most oppressive partisanship lo be\nm found In any commonwealth of this re-\npublic\nThis so-called non-partisan comml3\nm .flon form of government, passed by a\nm Republlnun legislature and signed by a\nm Republican governor, was enacted Into\nJm law without the consent of the governed,\nm for the manifest purpose of depriving tho\nm pepple of their Inalienable right of self-\nm governmc-nt for the benefit of a few who\nm claim the privilege pf ruling by right dl-\nm Whatever may bo the advantages of the\ncommission fonn of government where\nm officials are elected by the Independent\nm votes of a free people, the.y cantiot be\nlioped for in a community where a con-\nmm slderable number of voters exercise their\nBUffrage under instructions secretly pro\nmulcatcd by the partisan heads of a\nU church.\nNot Violating Law.\nShall the American voters of this city\nbo denied the privilege of concerted ac-\nmm Hon under the prctensu that the commis-\nmm slon Is intended to be non-purti.san? If\nthe selection of candidates by three, or\nthirteen, persons acting under tho\nshadow of the tomple, or by a solf-con-slltuled\ncommittee of scvcnty-llvc.

After quot\ning the law in the matter, he says In his\nletter:\n\"As to whether or not the failure to\nobserve this law Is due to the neglect\nof legal officials or is due to the disin\nterestedness of the public, I have to say\nthat.

Robinson.\nrfir4IJj) HE glories of the coronation\nI j of Eng!and\"s monarclis have.\nkCT-jJj been the theme of greatest\nfglll interest in the eyes of all\nMa\":en the world. And even In demo\ncratic America we hare been a bit\ndazzled thereby. The return of the\ngreat to mediaeval brilliance of color,\nand riot of gold and jewels, .for this\ngreat occasion, is reflected in the robes\noi Fashion generally. So that all of\nthe world shall catch a ray or two of\nthe glories of nobles and kings. Coro\nnation reel and king's blue arc not the\nonly darlincs of the mode that boast\n8 royal descent For there are In\nuuraerable opulent touches to he noted\nin gold embossed brocades and tinsel\ntassels. In beading, jeweling and heavy\nembroidery that hint at the Influence\nof the great and mysterious East. .\nAt a recent exhibition of Imported\nmodels, four examples of the success\nful exploitation of East Indian ideas\nere noted. The first was an after\nnoon costume of navy blue Liberty\nSatin, with Oriental \"embroideries,\ngleaming with meial throat?. It was\na one-piece robe effect, fastened down\nthe front and shirred in, at the waist\nline, where a girdle of plaited satin\ncords, with heavily weighted sash ends,\nconfined the fullness. The skirt was\nleft open almost to' knee height, so as\nto show the ankle In walking, the1\nfront sections lapping across each\nother. This gave a very narrow effect, i\nand wrapped the garment closely\nabout the figure, in such a manner as\nto clearly reveal its lines. This cos\ntume was In low tones, relieved by\nsumptuous embroideries of many col\nors, skilfully blended, and applied. In i\nsuch a manner as to seem woven with\nIH tQo fabric Itself. An evening costume,\nKJ by Paquln, also hespoke the influence\nHj of East India, in motive and coloring.\nHj The foundation lining was of a pecu-\nH liar shade of East Indian red chiffon,\nveiled -with a medium bright blue\nshade of the same material. The over\nhi dress was scattered with an embrold-\nHj cred floral pattern in heavy dull blue\nHj and mauve silk, and dark blue wooden\nMl beads. A deep band, at the hem, be-\nB low the chiffon tunic, was in striped\nJj silk and cotton East India tissue and\nH gave the appearance of an under petti-\n9yB coat The stripes were in blue, orange,\nJHH black, purple, green and pale blue, and\nfjjlfl gleaming with metal threads. Ap-\n11 PI pllqued motives of dark blue chiffon,\nllUm W,th embroIdered designs, further elab-l\nlw orated this underskirt. Heading the\nfRjH band, and as a sort of border to the\njllfifl chiffon tunic were dark blue wooden\nliilffl beads. This was a two-pleco dress,\nM in consisting of bodice and skirt, with a\nnjiyf girdle placed slightly above the nat-\nm ural waist line, at its lowest point\nHI As the girdle was wide, however, it\njflflgW Increased the short-walstcd effect. The\nWW bodice was of the surplice order, with\n\" characteristic double crosslae lines\nof the East Indian dress, and on the\nright breast, falling to one side, was\na jabot of the chiffon in Indian red\nand dark blue. The military sash\ngirdle and bands of the srarpllce front\nwere of changeable blue and purple\ntaffeta. The variety of colorB, in this\ncostume, was unusual, and yet so skil\nfully handled as to produce a delight\nfully harmonious effect\nAs has been noted, the general lines\nof afternoon and evening costumes in\ncline towards simpllclty; The high\nwaist line and rather narrow skirts\nprevail, in the majority of models,\nthough there are a few which show a\nleaning toward the 1830, rather than\nthe dlrectolrc modes. Fichu effects are\nnot uncommon, with here and there a\nsuggestion of bertha or bretelles.\nCords, tassels and fringes are wide\nly used as decoration-?, the latter be\ning especially noticeable. Naturally\nwith fringes to the fore, draped effects\nagain assert themselves. A three\npiece costume recently exhibited illus\ntrates this tendency perfectly. It in\nclined a bit toward the quaint 1S60\neffects, and had, as an entirely new\nfeature, the much talked of balloon\nsleeves, whose fullness at the elbow\nwas stretched on little hoops of feath\ncrbonc The bodice had a draped fichu\nabout the shoulders, bordered with\nfringe. below a small white net yoke,\ntrimmed with tiny buttons. Lavender\nblue, pernio crepe was the material\nchosen for this little gown and coat\nand the fringe was in the same color.\nThe flchu and under sleeves were of\nwhite chiffon, and the flchu collar of\nthe wrap was of white wool, The\nskirt of thl3 costume was in tunic ef\nfect, wrapping the figure closely, and\nthe edges. were bordered with fringe\nand heavily weighted in order to pro\nduce a close, clinging effect in the\ndraperies. The wrap was also In the\ndraped style, with fringe about the\nedges, the fronts draping over like\nthe ends of a shawl. The sleeves were\nhalf length and across the back was a\nlittle belt of shirring which held the\nwrap in to the figure at the waist line.\nTunic effects continue in favor, em\nbroidery bands, beading and fringes\nfinishing the lower edges and the\nsleeves. Bordered patterns, printed or\nembroidered, offer pleasing possibili\nties of manipulation into charming\ntunic costumes. KImona or butterfly\nsleeves still retain their hold -upon\npopular fancy, although the draped\nsleeve and the balloon sleeve, which\nare newer, have come to dispute their\npopularity. Very long, close fitting\nsleeves are a feature of many a smart\ncostume, suggesting early Italian styles.\nGirdles, sashes and cordeliers are in\nquaint harmony with the revival of\nthese antique modes, as arc also trim\nmings of marlbou and fur. Very soft\nsatin and messaline and softly draping\nwoolen fabrics are most appropriate\nin these clinging costumes, while voiles,\nmarquisettes, chiffon cloths, nnd crepes,\nboth plain and nsrured. nnnnnv in\ntunics and over-draperies. \" Heavy\nsurah silks have again made their aj\npearance in the field of fashion, after\nan absence of many years, and will\nfind n ready welcome.\nTaffeta, too, Is again modish, cos-'\ntumes In this material, fringe trimmed,\nwhich 'were one of the sensations of\nthe late summer, being shown as deml\ntoilettes, for Fall and Winter.\nShort coats und close skirls, giving\nthe fashionable slender outlines, are\nstill the favorites, though skirts are\nnot so narrow as they have been dur\ning the past few seasons, having at\ntained just the proper dimensions for\ngrace and ease.\nTwo to two and one-half yards Is an\n\"average measure about the hem of the\nsmart fall tailored skirt. Plain gored\neffects are, of course, ultra modish,\nbut there are many pretty models,\nshowing pleats let in at the side from\nknee to hem. Panel backs are well\nnigh universal, some circular skirts or\nskirts. with circular cut backs, being\nabout the only exceptions.\nTunic skirts of wool show simulat\ned under-sklrt effects of satin or vel\nvet, the collar lapels, cuffs -and other\ntrimmings of the jacket matching the\nunderskirt.\nJackets vary from twenty-sir to\ntwenty-eigtit, and even in some cases,\nthirty inches in length, affording a\nvery good range for individual selec-,\ntion. In addition to the usual straight\ncut coats there are many modfsh, semi\nfitted jackets, better suited to the lines\nof the average well-developed figure.\nVery narrow English cut shoulders\nappear upon the jackets of smart tail\nored suits, absolutely no fullness in\nthe top of the Bleeves being allowed.\nA few fancy suits are cut with the\nklmona or butterfly sleeve, which is\nessentially dressy. Coats, with high\nwaist line in the back, are also seen\non costumes for dressy wear. The real\nfashion features of fall snits and\ncoats are the handsome wide, fancy\ncollars, revers and broad cuffs, carried\nout in a variety of novel ways. These\nare often of contrasting color and fab\nric, or inlaid with velvet, braid, or\ncontrasting cloth.\nBoth double and single breasted ef\nfects appear in the fall models, though\nthe formar, perhaps, best suits the\npurposes of fancy revers and collars.\nAll kinds of rough, heavy materials\nare smart for tailored suits, bourette\ncloth, basket weaves and fancy mix\ntures being the order of the day, va\nried with a few mannish suitings.\nZibellne, plain and In two-toned, ef\nfects, are again In style, as might be\nexpected with the vogue for long-j\nhaired fabrics. Striped zibellne show\nred or white hair lines, on dark\n1\nBy\nLouise Beaufort '\ni\ngrounds. Striped suitings, of all kinds,\nare very smart, for Fall and. \"Winter\nwear.\nFor dressy wear, velvet suits will\ntake the place of the satin models,\nwhich achieved such a triumph during\nthe spring and summer. Embroidery,\non velvet. Is a new idea in adornment,\nthe designs being executed either in\nheavy silk or colored worsted. Browns,\npurples, black and white effects, grays\nand dark blues are all modish and ap\npropriate for the fall tailor-made. The\npopularity of pretty little dresses of\nwool or slrk, and of short jacket tailored\nsuits, renders at least one long coat\nan essential of the well balanced win\nter wardrobe. Never was fashion's\ndisplay of outer wraps more lavish\nthan for this season, the automobile,\nperhaps, having had some influence\nupon the vogue for long coats.\nThe fifty-four Inch coat is. in fact,\npreferred above all others, which is at\nCL OAK A ND SUIT HO USE j\n1 258-260 South Main Street \"The Store That Gives Value'\nSuch a World of Pretty, New j\nMillinery . fllK' I\ng ''Smartest tailored hats in Salt Lake City nro a l' Gray's.\" lSf!\n1 A comment you hsivc heard a number of limes and .justly .so. ffiffitfL ffip2 jj\n1 Perfection of style characterizes Gray's hats at all times, color- mjlh llflvM 81 U\nI hijrs of beauty, tone harmonics oF daring originality, i'reshne.ss Jjc0'\nI of design not to be found elsewhere priced one-fourth to one- jVSo\njjj third less than those of any other local house.

Skunk,\nanother natural, durable and\nTely inexpensive fur, also\npopularity of the last few\nseasons, Mole skin is also Shown In\ncombination with other furs, or made\nup in sets, with trimmings of passe\nmentrie. The working of mole-skin\nand seal in patterns is one of the\nnovelties of the present fur season. In\nvery high priced fur, mink promises\nto be a leader for general wear, while\nthe \"Coronation\" has given an im\npetus to ermine, as a fur for dressy\noccasions. The -little tails, which are\nusually sewed throughout an ermine\ngarment, are arranged more sparingly\non this season's creations, and in some\ncases entirely omitted. Some very\nbroad scarfs of seal have linings of\nplain ermine.\nRed, gray, brown and black fox are\nall used extensively, and tipped fox\nis exceedingly modish. \"White fox, for\nevening wear, always has a large num\nber of admirers, and Is used this sea\nson, as formerly, In pretty, fluffy sets,\nor as a trimming to garments of er\nmine. Fewer heads and tails are seen on\nfurs than for some years past, and\nthis would seem an advance in taste.\nOf course, there are fox sets, and sets\nof raccoon and fisher, in natural, ani\nmal shades, but for the most part\nbroad pelerine and shawl collar ef\nfects, with trimmings of passamentrle,\nbraid, fringe or tassels prevail, ac\ncompanied by plain muffs, slightly\nsmaller than the modish ones of last\nseason. The best shape of muff is\nundoubtedly the half-barrel, or pillow\nvariety, which has much of the grace\nful roundness of the barrel muff, with\nout its bulk and awkwardness.\nVery large pelerines of mink, er\nmine and chinchilla, in effect whole\nwraps of the shawl or cape variety,\nare exhibited for those whose purses\ncan stand such luxuries, and are\namong the most graceful designs of\nthis decade.\nThe woman who cannot, for any\nreason, consider a full length fur coat,\nwill find comfort In the many pretty\nshort jackets of fur that arc to be the\nsmart thing this winter. These little\nshort coats are usually about the\nlength of the fashionable suit jacket,\nwhich is twenty-six to twenty-eight\ninches, arid they are modeled on much\nthe same lines. Etons of fur are also\npretty and correct, taking the place of\nthe large pereline. or fur scarf. These\nshort coats are usually of seal or Hud\nson seal, broad-tall, astrachan or\nbaby lamb with collars and cuffs, or\nother trimmings, of fuller, fluffier fur.\nThe Etons are sometimes bordered all\nabout with contrasting fur, while the\njackets show, a great variety of large\nshawl collars and revers of raccoon,\nfox or skunk.\nSailor collars, even, are used on\nfnr coats, some In square, some In\nround, and some In pointed effects.\nForty-five inch coats of fur are oc\ncasionally seen, and offer an excellent\ncompromise between the merits of the\nfull-length coat and the short jacket\nFichn effects in stoles of short, fine\nfur, are sometimes caught at the waist\nwith a handsome buckle or ornament.\nThere is a general revolutionary sug\ngestion about present fur fashions, es\npecially noticeable in fichu and cape\neffects, and in broad collars and deep\ncuffs.\nTurbans of fur. to match muff and\nscarf, or jacket trimmiugs, are also\nin good style. A fur turban, worn\nwith a fur coat, and matching the\nrevers, cuffs and muff, gives a delight\nfully picturesque finish to a winter\ncostume.\nIn selecting furs, one should bear\nin mind that no one fur is universally\nbecoming. Skunk is quite generally so, 1\nand mink likewise, but the gray and\nblack furs are not for all faces. As a\nrule, they, are most becoming to\nblondes and light-.complexioned people,\ngenerally, and to those with gray hair.\nVery youthful faces always look well\nabove light furs. Women of olive\ncomplexion should always select a fur\nwith a brownish cast, unless their hair\nis of a raven bla-ckness, when a black\nfur may be worn. White furs are\nmost becoming to dark or rosy faces,\nthe roses of old Jack Frost, however,\nrender them wearable by many who\naxe otherwise pale. A little study of\nthe possibilities of fur in enhancing\nthe beauty of the complexion, by con\ntrast, is not only interesting, but well\nworth while, as It enables one to\nachieve superior effects,\ntm\n\" Fashions May Come BBiBBH\nft jyiifc Fashions May Go\n'\"mmmi'K Wms$ Frank's Prices Remain Low\nvSBMWW 9 1911\"12 Faii aGd Winter Opening, IHB\nBrffl'! and Low-Price Demonstration lSmHIIGHH\nJ SHff MONDAY and Week\n''fWjrjvJS 9 Jl assemblage of clever creations for the smart dressers IBHBfflilWiW\nm 9i kake anc victory.

X .RoMnson.\nIjO many lovely, creations, large\n(j R and small, quaint and\nfeW I smart, have the milliners\npjjyliP designed for our delight\nduring the Inst two seasons\nChat it seemed almost out of the ques\nitlon that even Paris could offer any\nthing new for Fall. Yet here they\nere with us, the new models, seem\ning, as ever, smarter and more bravely\n; line than the old, Also, alas, they are\neo unlike any former fashions that\nremodelling last year's hat for this\nyear Is altogether out of the question.\n' The most radical departure from all\nrecent millinery precedent is the very\nhigh, pointed crown, narrow brim,\n\"Pierrlot\" shape, which is the real\nstyle note of the day. These crowns\neire rarely less than ten inches In\nheight, and very often more. They\nnxe very narrow, even at the base, ana\ntaper to a rounded or flattened conical\ntop. The brims are usually pinched\nIn a poke across the front, or at the\nback, and sometimes they are poked\nfit both sides, being plain, back and\nfront This high, narrow, conic or\nPierriot\" shape Is a very practical\none, as it fits the head well. It is de\nsigned to be worn without rats, puffs\nor any distended, artificial coiffure ar\nrangement,\ni The high, narrow hat, while pre\ndominant, ill not, by any means, en\ntirely displace the picture hat of ample\nbrim and generous curves. This type\nof chapchu is altogether too elegant\nJcind too becoming to a large number\nof women to permit of itB being has\ntily . relegnted to the limbo of things\npast and forgotten. The ultra-smart\nlarge hat will be jnst as large aB ever,\nt not so ubiquitous, and will be flatter\nthan ever, with crown barely raised\nnbovc the brim, by the scantiest al\nlowance of inches.\nSome medium large hats are being\nfashioned with high crowns, but they\n.will scarcely have the appeal of the\nflatter, wider models. The large hat\nIs now looked upon as exclusively a\ndress affair, and not for the \"highways\nand byways\" of the market-place,\nrriila it? as it should be, and a wel\ncome innovation to those who have\nfmffered from Its ezpansiveness in\npublic conveyances, elevators and the\ncrowded streets.\n1 Old-fashioned poke bonnets are\nmodish still, and this is fortunate, for\nj they have a certain quaint prettiness,\nfercll in keeping with demure, young\njHagd or round fnces. The woman who looks\n919 wril in them usually looks amazingly '\n1 well, better, in fact, thnn In almost\nHm any other \"type of headgear. Before\nHjHgB rmsslug by' the old-fashloued poke, as\nP too extreme, one should try it on, at\nleast, for it may prove a revelation.\nThese old-fashioned bonnets are some\ntimes edged about with fringe, a\ntrimming in perfect harmony with\ntheir lines. They are usually made of\nvelvet, and the sheltering brims are\nlined or faced with taffeta, or sntin.\nVelvet, by the way, is the material\npar excellence for the fashionable\nwinter hat It is used both on pressed\nand hand-made shapes, alone and in\ncombination with satin, taffeta, hat\nter's plus and fur felt. Uncut velvet\nIs a novelty, both for hats and trim\nmings, very rich in appearance, but\nmore resembling cord silk than ordi\nnary velvet\nAll kinds of silks and velvets are\nemployed in the fashioning of winter\nhats and bonnets, satins, corded silks,\nmoires, and plushes having been rein\nforced by the advent of taffeta, into\nthe millinery field. The vogue' of taf\nfeta gowns, trlmnfed with fringes,\nwhich took Paris by storm during the\nlate summer, has given an impetus to\nthis fabric for winter millinery. Hats\nof felt and velvet are faced with taf\nfeta, and taffeta is sometimes pressed\nupon the upper Bides of hats with felt\nor velvet facings.\nFrench crepe is new as a material\nfor hat facings, and-affords a delight\nfully soft and becoming background\nfor the face. The head sizes of the\nnew hats remain large, and though a\nbit closer than of late seasons, they\nstill allow the hats to sink well over\nthe face.\nFor all practical purposes this will\nbe quite a ribbon season, as very wide,\nplain and fancy ribbons are used ex\ntensively as trimmings for hats of all\nkinds. Particularly Is this true of the\nnew, high-crowned, narrow-brimmed\nhats, which are very generally trimmed\nwith ribbon. Ribbons show some\nvery handsome new, double-faced ef- .\nfects, the reverse side of brighter hue\nappearing in a band upon the upper\nside of darker color. These ribbons\nare trimmed about the new high\ncrowns, fold upon fold, with these\nbright edges at each fold, and meeting\nIn a bias seam in front. The crown\nis thus entirely coveTed, and at the\nback rises a wired crest of ruffled rib\nbon, in plume effect, very fall and\nfluffy, and upstanding to an even\ngreater height than the crown of tho\nhat Velvet and silk are also arranged\non these hats, in the same fashion as\nribbon, or in short, sharp, up-standing\nbowa, covering the crowns and simu\nlating wings.\nWings, faacy feathers, ana aigrette.\nHAIR GOODS TX\nSPECIALS ,4tok\nWe have here listed\nRome \"vvonderfnl hair\nevery woninn\nelsewhere f oX . tKfs\nTrained attendant of long experience will assist you in mak\ning selections and gladly advise you how to dress your hair\nmore becomingly.\nRegular $2.75 switch, 22 inches long, e Q c\nMorris price .-...

These are the chains that have\na separate piece, about three inches\nin length depending from the juncture\nto which the locket is usually at\ntached. The locket or watch which is\noften worn in this way, when fastened\nto the end of this chain thus lies much\nlower than formerly.

The embroidering has\ntaken on the popular Oriental charac\nter, In both design and coloring,\nthough the use of color is usually re\nstricted to one shade so that the slip-\npers may harmonize with the gown.\nMetal embroidery is also seen on the'\nantin slippers, while metal buckles of\nevery description ornament street as\nwell as dress slippers.\nThe trousseau will not be complete\nwithout at least a pair or two of the\nadorable boudoir slippers.

This is a per\nennial style, with which the practical\nwoman could hardly afford to dis\npense. \"With long coats so fashionable this\nseason, the separate waist and skirt\nwill Hnd a yet larger field of useful\nness, and designers and makers have\nprovided some unusually chic styles In\nboth garments. Separate skirts, of\ncourse, follow the general lines preva\nlent In suit skirtings. They are of the\n. same width and much the same cut,\nplain gored modelB, and model9 with\npleats let In at the sides from tho\nknee down. There are also a few\nskirts with hems slashed, to show tho\nfoot and ankle. This is, however, an\nextreme style, and a more popular ar\nrangement Is the simulated slash,\nwith a contrasting piece of fabric in\ntroduced In a triangular fold beneath\nthe slashed hem.\nThe raised waist line continues pop\nular in skirts, the height varying with\nthe taste of the wearer. Many skirts,\nhowever, are contrived in the regular\nway with a bnnd at the waist, to be\nworn with a fancy belt, or a belt of\nthe skirt material. This style of\nskirt might be expected, as a great\nmany of the most fashionable waists\nare made with a peplum effect, to be i\nworn outside of the skirt. Others,\nagain, have very wide folded satin :\ngirdles, designed to be worn outside\ntho skirt belt. These waists are\nsometimes made with the outer drap\nery and girdle separated from the\nlining, which slips underneath the\nsldrt belt, while the outer material\nand girdle fit over It.\nDraped and veiled blouses will be as\nwidely worn as ever . this winter,\nnearly all of the dressiest waists be\ning veiled In chiffon. Very handscsne\nwaists are designed -for afternoon and\nevening wear, with separate skirts,\nreal lace, hand embroidery and head\ning being the most usual form of dec\noration. Sleeves are, for the moat part,\nthree-quarter lengths, and styles are\nwell divided hetween the klmona or\nseamless shoulder and' the set-In, or\n6eamed variety. Some of the new\nsleeves are smooth over the shoulder,\nin klmona lines and with a puffed\nsection attached a few Inches below,\nreminding one of the sleeves of the\nbasques and jackets of the 1S60 days.\nStrictly tailored waists have often\nfull length sleeves .of the set-in vari\nety, finished with the regulation cuff.\nSome very dressy lingerie blouses have\nalso full length sleeves, with frilled\nturned-back cuffs, and high-boned col\nlars.

Some architects, indeed, go so\nfar as to design houses to fit the\nappearance and character of the occu\npants, even as one might thus design\nwearing apparel, and, after all, though\na trifle extreme, the idea is far from\nillogical.\nMany of the older and well-defined\ndecorative periods, however, offer a\nsetting quite generally suitable to the\naverage American family. Sbereton,\nChippendale. Adams, Happelwhite and\nWilliam and Mary designs, in furni\nture, are of such a delightfully grace\nful and simple character as to be\nalmost universally acceptable. Colo\nnial fashions, in architecture and fur\nniture, are an adaptation of English\nand French designs also widely appro\npriate throughout the states descended\n'from the colonies.\nOften composite effects prove pleas\ning, a mingling of decorative elements\nfrom different periods, if Judiciously\nhandled, possessing both harmony and\ncharm. Many decorators, in fact, advo\ncate a not. too strict adherence to\nperiod, claiming that to break up the\nperiod a Kit relieves monotony.\nColor Is an ever Important factor\nin decoration and furnishing: for a\ncolor scheme, well chosen, will render\nattractive any but an exceptionally\nunfortunate selection, or collection, of\nhousehold goods.

' It wis found to\nand floors, and even curtains and uphol-1\nstery, relieved with bright bits of color i\nin pottery, tapestry and pictures, is,\nperhaps, the happiest and most reli\nable arrangement.\nElaborate schemes involving daring,\nrich or brilliant colors, should be en\ntrusted only to the expert by whose\nskilled hands they may be safely ac\ncomplished. A not too lively shade of autumnal\nbrown, for living room walls, is de\nlightful with the many shades of oak\nfurniture, now so popular, such as\nfumed oak, mission oak. weathered oak\nor Flemish oak. Early English oak,\nslightly lighter and richer In tone,\ngoes well with tapestry effects in\nmingled green and brown, leaf designs\nas a background in the wall covering.\nWith mahogany furniture, pale gray,\nor gold, and white enamel, is very\npretty for walls and woodwork, while\nCircassian walnut allows a back\nground of dull rose or bluish hue.\nDark oak is likewise handsome with\nrather brilliant blue, even a delft being\npermissible, though such strong colors\nare not generally advisable.\nIn decorating and furnishing the home,\nit is well to bear in mind the variety\nof colors and costnme which season\nand occasion may assemble within its\nwalls and to keep the broader tones\nof living room and dining room, at\nleast, of so neutral a character as to\nafford a charming background for any\nwell-chosen costume.

Another important factor is the bal\nancing of plain and figured surfaces.\nWall paper, rugs, hangings, upholstery,\nall of a decided and different pattern,\nproduce a most violent effect, in spite\nof good color. Monotone hangings,\nwall decoration, upholstery and rugs,\non the contrary, with their unrelieved\nPaga 11\nplain surfaces, tend to produce a feel\ning of monotony, though not of neces\nsity depressing. A room otherwise in\nplain surfaces gains greatly In charm\nwhen relieved by Oriental rugs, era\nbroldered cushions, in arts and craft,\nor Oriental patterns and rich colors,\nwith an abundance of pictures and\nbric-a-brac. After all, some of tho\nbest effects in home adornment are\nan outgrowth of necessity, for often\nthe woman who has little money to\nspend must spend so much more fl\nthought upon her purchases, and all of H\nher acquisitions must be so carefully fl\nconsidered, that the result is perfect H\nharmony, brought about, by an assem- B\nbling of exactly the right and rightly fl\nchosen objects of adornment.

' every home the need of\nB Hi n tkS8 purely rosthetic la\nI felt, and the Ideals ofwhnt\nffi35SS)J is nsstbnfic expressed In varl\n' ous ways. Wreaths of hair,\nwax and feather flowers, or embroid\nered mottoes Eatlsfied these cravings\n1n many homes of a generation or two\nago, and always the handicraft, of the\nhome worker has, to some degree,\nsupplied this need.\nIn this day of broader culture and\ntruer teste we are indeed fortunate\nin having at our command so many\nsources of artistic delight from which\nto draw. Pretty pieces of pottery,\n' well designed, new embroideries, grace\nful baskets and art lamps offer innu\nmerable charming suggestions for\nbrightening the odd nooks and corners\nf the home.\nI Pottery, indeed, even the most inex\npensive, may be highly artistic and\npossessed of a great, decorative value.\nThe cultivation of a taste along this\nline will enable one to select things\ngood in contour and color, even though\nlow In price. Some rather heavy Jap\nancEe pieces of dull, grayish stone\nware, with a merely indicated decora\n.tlon of green branches and white flow\ners, were recently offered at prices\nranging from fifteen to thirty-five\ncents in a certain store, and yet they\n..were decidedly harmonious and taste\nful, satisfying even the most artistic\nJapanese, and Chinese blue, in his\ntoric patterns on vases and jardinieres,\ncan often ho procured at a very low\nfigure, and yet the decoration Is ex\nactly the same as that upon some rare\npiece of old Hawthorne in an art mu\nseum or palace, for which a sum of\n:from five to ten thousand dollars has\n'been expended, ihe great age of the\nlatter piece, rather than its superior\nbeauty, accounting for the price.\nAmong American potteries there are\nmany lovely pieces in dull, pale,\nopaque glazed effects which, though\nhigher in price than Oriental wares,\nare yet far from being unattainable\ntreasures.\nBrown baskets have recently sprung\ninto favor for decorative nses. As\ncenter pieces upon tables, receptacles\nfor .bright colored fruit, or for ferns,\nthese rich, brown-toned wicker works ,\nof woven willow or split bamboo are ,\nsimply Irresistible. Very handsonfe\nbaskets may be procured at from ono\nto five dollars; filled with moss and\npreserved ferns they afford very artls-\ntic Ideas In table decoration. Arti\nficial flowers nre also used to good\nadvantage in these baskets,, as are\nautumn leaves, dried flowers, cat-tails\nand prettily colored grasses. Arti\nGclal flowers are now recognized as\nquite correct for home ndornmcnt, and,\nIndeed, some of them nre so well done\nas easily to pass for the real. Pre\nserved maiden, hair fern Is likewise so\nnatural in appearance that one can\nscarcely tell it from the fresh grow\ning plant It has proven a boon to the\nwoman who never has any luck with\nflowers and must constantly Eend her\nfernery to the florist to he refilled.\nWicker and basket lamps are among\ntho new things also, and shades of\nbamboo or wicker, slllc-IIned, with\nbases of pottery or bronze. Some very\npretty effects in willow lamps for\nsummer homes nre obtained by lining\nthe open-work shades with bright flow\nered cretonne. A lamp and shade of\nthis kind, in willow pointed green, had\na shade lining of very rich .red rose\nand dark green leaved cretonne,\nthrough which the light wrought beau\ntiful effects.\nAnother idea is the matching of pat\ntern upon the silk or cretonne shade\nand pottery or porcelain lamp base.\nIn the decorators' window some very\npretty effects are displayed in ChlneEe\nvases which have been fltted with elec\ntric light fixture's, and shades of Chi\nnese cretonne, or silk, matching the\npattertr of the vase.\nLamps have grown to be objects of\nart almost within the last two decades,\nwith tho rather general adoption of\nelectric light. We have come suddenly\nfrom a time when a really beautiful\nlamp was a rarity to a day of bewild\nering variety and beauty in Illuml\nnarles. Side lighting fixtures nnd table\nlamps are given preference today over\nthe central over-head fixtures, so long\nregarded ns 'essential and inevitable.\nThis Is as it should be, for a light\nmore nearly on a level with the face\nJ is vastly more becoming than over\nhead illumination, -which throws gro-.\ntcsquo dark shadows upon the face.\nSide fixtures are likewise more artis\ntic and more readily adaptable as mo\ntives in the general scheme of decora\ntion. . Lamps and lighting fixtures are very\ncarefully designed to blend harmoni\nously with interiors of every type and\nperiod. Next to color, light is all im\nportant In home decoration, and the\nchoice and placing of lights should\ntherefore be most carefully considered.\nBiJl -desi11 an( the scope and variety of se-\nIffRnn lection of our display of antique jew- Mt\nIHT eky charm the most critical. nffl\nHW' $11 e cordially invite you to visit us and fBBl\nWW examine at your leisure the largest col-\nlection of real Mosaic rareties in the jm\nIThe Cecilian Piano I\nThat Anyone Can Play W\nIf you have music in your soul you need not be, restrained by having untrained jffl\nfingers.

Robinson.)\nTho custom of bringing to tabic tu\nreens of soup and plalters of meat\nseems to be falling into disuse in this\nday and age. At many homes tables\nnowadays the service is quite similar,\nin this respect, to that, of a public eat\ning place, and while this may be\nmost, convenient and graceful for tho\nformal diuncr5 there is something in\nfinitely more, homelike about service\nat the hand of tho host, himself, from\ncapacious turocu or well-tilled platter.\nThis custom, happilj'. is not entirely ob\nsolete, it being adhered to by stmic of\nthe best, families.\njAmong the moro pleasing innovations\nin table dressing is the fashion of\npresenting each course in a service of\ndifferent design and coloring. This al\nlows for a scries of artistic studies in\nprett- china, tastefully arranged, and\nis a relief from tho monotony of the\nlargo dinner set in ono design through\nout. It may also prove a great cou\ncnicnco to tho woman who finds is im\npossible lo match tho pattern of her\nchina and keep a full set, in perfect\ncondition, by replacing breakages with\nnew pieces. It offers au opportunity to\nutilize odd single course services, which\nmay have come into the housewife's\npossession as gifts.\nGood taste suggests a certain range\nof color for the different services,\nthough, of courac, there is much lati\ntude here for individual predilection.\nAs a rule, white and gold is tho best\nchoice for the service plate, as it har\nmonizes with plates in almost any\nother color which may \"be placed upon\nit. Oyster plates, with a green deco\nration\", arc perhaps preferable to all\nothers, as this color is in harmony\nwith the tones of the bivalve and sug\ngests the sea. tiohl hands, or traceries,\nina3' relievo the- plain green and white\ncombination.

Tho small soup plate not ouly\npossesses tho advantage of being much\ndaintier in suggestion than I he old\nnine-inch variety, but also allows a\nbetter appreciation of tho decorated\nrim of tho service plate. Fish plates\nmay be in tho natural decoration of\nlive lish, with sparkling waves and\naquatic plants, or in simple conven\ntionalized designs, in green and white,\nor white and gold. The service of\ngaino or cntrco may exhibit a decided\nred in tho border, with strong touches\nof gold and blaclc. , Tor tho body of\ntho meal, simplo whito and gold usu\nallv prevails, though very rich designs\nin \"which cobalt or torquise blue or\nvarious shades of rose arc blended\nwith intricate gold traceries aro also\nin favor.

This\nIs wby, whenever possible, it Is best\nto buy good Oriental rugs, which have\nto recommend them not. only their sur\npassing beauty and value as works of\nart, but qualities of endurance as\nwell, far beyond those of almost any\nother floor covering. Of course the\nprice exceeds that of other rugs, and\nyet not so greatly as not to prove an\neconomy In the long run.\nA' good rug should, aud will, with,\ntho proper care, last nt least a life\ntime, even \"under the hard conditions\nof wear In this country. In the Orient,\nwhere the custom of removing one's\nstreet shoes, or sandals, upon entering\na bouse prevails, these rugs Inst for\ngenerations, and improve in color and\nSurface finish as they gather age.\nThe dyes, which Impart the beauti\nful hues to the yarn used in these\nrugs, are all of a vegetable nature,\nand the colors therefore tone perfectly\nwith the passage of time. Contact\nwith the heavy woolen stockings, worn\nthe year round by Oriental people,\ncauses the yarn of the nap of the rug\nto unravel, and polishes the surface,\nj\nthus imparting a wonderful silken\nsheen. So much admired by collectors\nIs this velvety appearance that rug\ndealers have resorted to various means\nto produce this gloss artificially.\nDampening the surface with a solution\nof glycerine, and pressing with very\nhot irons, Imparts something the same\neffect, but does not Improve the rug.\nOne should therefore favor a rug\nwhich does not exhibit this character\nistic too strongly, as, unless the price\nbe very high, one may be sure that\nthe gloss is not natural.\nA still more damaging practice, re\nsorted to both In the Orient and here.\nIs the so-called washing process. New\nrugs, in the vivid hues of freshly dyed\nwools, are stretched on Inclined boards,\nover which chlorine water Is permit\nted to flow. This fades the surfaces,\nIn soft tones, but so weakens the fibre\nof the rag as to cut its lifetime In two.\nA washed rug can easily be detected,\nas upon examination It will be found\nthat only the surface of the nap is in\ndull tones, very bright colors appear\nback of the rug.

The sleeves will have\neither real or simulated cuffs with\nthree buttons. The vest, of the same\nmaterial as the coat, will carry five\nbuttons, and will appear nearly an\nInch above the coat opening. The\nmorning coat, or cutaway, as it Is better\nknown, is popular with a certain ele\nment, especially among professional,\nmen who do not enre to wear the double-breasted\nfrock the \"Prince Albert\"\nduring business hours. This coat\nwill also be largely In evidence for\nafternoon wear.\nThe former habit of appearing in\nthe afternoon, at any sort of function,\nno matter how informal, in a Back or\nlounge suit, has practically disap\npeared. It was due partly to careless\nness and partly to want of knowl\nedge as to the demands of propriety.\nBut the American public is now so\nwidely Informed ns to these things,\nthat the former\" excuses no longer, ex\nist, and the custom is now a thing of\nthe past. Today, a man with social\npretensions, even of the humblest,\nfeels entirely out of place unless clad\nin a cutaway, or frock in the social\ncenters of the country, and this is\nespecially true when he is in the com\npany of ladies. In other words, the\nAmerican now heeds the edicts of\nfashion, and appears properly ac\ncoutored for business and social en\ngagements. For town clothes, certainly the most\npopular of all is the morning or cut\naway coat The correct morning salt\nL for the coming season will be a black\nor dark gray coat, with waistcoat of\nthe same material, and gray trousers\nwith a narrow stripe. If the coat Is\nof gray, the trousers should match. A\nnarrow strip of black braid, set in 14\nof an inch from the edge of both coat\nand waistcoat, forms an attractive and\npleasing novelty. The braid is also\nset on the pocket flaps, the same dis\ntance from the edge. The coat has a\nwelted breast pocket.\nOne of the things which makes the\nmorning coat 60 popular is the facfc\nthat it is better suited to the average\n.\nagJMMM'P I iiwawgaa i bin anwam i\nTake Your Boy to W\nBoys appreciate style as well ML\nas men do.

The lat\nter are smart on corpulent men: but\nwhen one is possessed of a good figure,\nhe much prefers wearing the morning\nor cutaway coat.\nFor semi-formal wear, the double\nbreasted frock haB not yet been dis\nplaced, nor is it likely to be for many\nseasons. Th fact, it is coming into its\nown again to a greater degree this\nwinter than for several seasons past.\nMen of middle age and past will wear\nit more than ever. During the Coro\nnation period this coat and the black\nsilk hat were more in evidence In\nLondon than for several years before;\nthe mo6t prominent tailors of the\n\"WesiEnd, In the English metropolis,\npredict that they will be fully as pop\nular, if not more so, from now until\nnext spring.\nFor the coming season the morn\ning or cutuway coat will be made to\nroll, with three buttons, set In closely\ntogether. The roll is quite soft to the\nfirst button. Only the second button\nof this coat Is designed to button,\nThe buttons are not silk-covered, but\nare of bone, black of course. Some\nof these coats will be shown, espe\ncially among the custom trade, with\na double-breasted lapel with soft roll;\nbut this style will be the exception\nand not the rule.\nThe sleeves are finished with four\nbuttons close together, and a real cuff;\nthey are cut very narrow, 10 or 12j\ninches at the outside, and fehort\nenough in length to show at least\nInch of the starched shirt cuff. The\nbuttons on the sleeve must bultou\nthrough, with worked button-holes.\nThis coat Is very walsty, or form\nfitting, and is usually worn buttoned.\nThe tendency to button the waist\ncoat high has been somewhat modified\nfor the fall season. It musj, not be\ncut too high nor too low, but nt a\nhappy medium, and must be in a direct\nline with the roll of the coat. The\nwaistcoat opening is a moderate V in\nshape. Five buttons are correct for\na coat cut not too long, and the last\nbutton of the waistcoat should never\nbe buttoned. There Is positively' no\nexcuse for a chain hole.\nTrousers will be a little more on\nthe order of the pegged top for tho\ncoming season. They should taper\nnicely to the bottom, and care should\nbe taken to see that the back of the'\ntrousers come within an inch of thc\nground. They should not bag nor bulge\nover thc front of the hoot, which\nmeans that there should be a good\nslope Ln the cut. Raised side searuB\nof the wide type are fashionable.\nThere is a decided revival of the\ndemand for striped effects in the\ndarker shades for the coming season,\nas these designs nre more adapted for\nautumn and winter. These new effects\nHre heavier looking than the old style,\nand, in many instances, there is a\nvery distant double Stripe which gives\nthe cloth a moat pronounced appear\nance.

During the past summer\nIt was worn very little by men of\ntaste; for Its appearance Is untidy and\ni it proved no more comfortable than\nthe usual starched linen collar. For\nthe fall and winter It is not In evl-\ndence at all, and probably will not be\nrevived next spring.\nPractically all shirts carry .the\nFrench cuffs that Is, the uris'tarehed,\nI turned-back kind. These are worn\nalmost universally at all times except\nfor more or less formal functions that\ncall for starched white linen. They\nmay be obtained at all prices, from\n$1.50 up.

These, and the\nless expensive grades, made from linen,\nmuslin, and other fabrics, including\npercales, madras and surah silks, are\nworn to business by young and old.\nby men of moderate Income and those\nwho can afford to gratify expensive\ntastes. 1\nA swell shirting, which will be made\nup for the fall and winter in both\nnegligee and pleated, is the Russian\ncord. This Is found mostly in laven\nder, blue and tan, and will undoubt-l\ncdly be 'extremely popular among the\nhlgh-clas3 trade. Pique and mercer\nized detachable collars are on sale, but1\nhaberdashers do not predict any exten\nsive demand for them.\nNeckwear Is shown in an astonish\ning variety of weaves and patterns,\nboth in four-in-hands and \"bat wing\"\nties. The latter arc In great favor\nfor early fall, and may be had in\naccordeon weaves, solid colors, stripes,\ndiagonals and \"polka dots.\"\nThe latter pattern has come into\nstyle again, and will bo worn exten\nsively during the coming season, espe\ncially Iru four-in-hands. So far, the\ndots are confined to white against dark\nblue or some other solid color; they\nvary in size from a quarter to half\nan inch In diameter.\nThe newest thing in neckwear, de\nsigned, especially for the fall trade, is\nknown as the handkerchief scarf. This\nis a four-in-hand, of generous size;\nmost of them are exceedingly gaudy,\ncarrying brilliant combinations of col\nors in what is designated ns Persian\ndesigns. \"It is astonishing,\" said ' a\nprominent haberdasher, \"to see how\nmen's tastes change; this is no longer\na feminine prerogative. Thousands of\nmen are wearing today the brightest\ncombinations of color imaginable men\nwho a short while ago would not have\nthought of wearing anything but black,\nwhite, gray, or the soberest combina\ntions.\" But the preference for the quieter\ncombinations still exerts an influence,\nand for the fall, besides the brilliant\nPersian designs inrumchundas and fou\nlards, are many plain colors and com\nbinations with neat, attractive effects\nin stripes nnd diagonals. In fact, I\nhave been informed that fully 60 per\ncent of the neckties sold of late have\nbeen in solid colors or in \"self stripes\nthat is, stripes of the same color,\nbut different shade, as the body of\nthe tie.\nIn the more exclusive trade exclu\nsive, in this connection, usually means\nnothing more than expensive some\nhouses show a striking novelty in a\nfour-in-hand of bright scarlet, made\nof Irish muslin, which sells for $1.50.\nNetted neckwear is practically de Sv.(\nA new design, created especially fori\nautumn, is of alternating stripes of\ngray and green, each stripe being\ninch wide, and composed of countless j\nsmaller stripes In the weave. This isj\na- decided novelty, and extremely at-j\ntractive to the eye. j\nFancy waistcoats are to be had prac-j\ntically without restriction as to style,\nor pattern. Perhaps the most popu-'\nlar, and certainly one of the nicest in\nappearance, is made of silk or velvet\nwith perpendicular stripes, less than\na quarter of an inch wide, of black\nand silver gray. For autumn wear are\nBorne of white vyelle flannel, with nar\nrow stripe's of blue or black. The Tux\nedo and dress vest is of white French\npique; with the dinner coat simple\neffects In gray and In black-and-white\nmay be worn.\nIn underwear, union suits vie with\ntwo-piece suits in about equal ratio;\nin the former, the suit with half arms\nand ankle-length drawers, which costs\nfrom .$1.50 up, seems to be in great\nfavor. These come in crepe, solsette\nand heavier fabrics\".\nHardly any socks are to be seen\nexcept silk and silk-and-lisle. It is\nactually true that real silk socks have\nbeen sold for 25 cents a pair; the\naverage price for the fall trade Is 35\ncents, or three pairs for a dollar. Cot\nton and woolen socks are shown only\nwhen called for. They are all in solid\ncolors, no stripes or other combinations\nbeing on view.\nJewelry for men's wear, for formal\ndress or otherwise, is measured only\nby the contents of the buyer's purse.\nAlmost everything is \"matched\" nowa\ndays comes In \"sets,\" including shirt\nstuds, vest buttons, cuff links, and,\nwhen the studs are not worn, stickpin\nas well.

The shoes pro-\nstandard makers for the com\n'S&son are the most shapely that\n'Hecn seen for a long time. No\nK are shown In toe or heel, or\nfKolnts. The \"bulldog\" effect is\nST' throughout the West, but is\niKttt at all on the new shoes in\nbt which are now on exhibition\n,pj and winter custom.\n!E; surprising to observe how the\nhas superseded the dull black\nKjag tic ordinary black calf or\nkid shoe that hag to be \"shlnca\" in\norder to present a decent appearance.\nIn mo3t of our larger cities men of\nbusiness and social affairs have prac\ntically abandoned that; they wear tan\nshoes until six o'clock In the evening,\nand then put on the pnteut leathers\nif they are going out; otherwise they\ndon comfortable slippers or' \"Juliets.\"\nLaced tan shoes, medium weight for\nearly fall and heavier weight for later,\nstormy days, are now on exhibition.\nShoe denlers tell me that they expect\nto sell them all winter long, and have\nfour or five new lines on hand.\nThe patent leather shoe for dress\nor semi-dress this fall will have five\nbuttons, flat and black. The shapes\nof all shoes are what the dealers des\nignate ua \"conservative,\" ana show the\neffect of the English last. The toes\nnre narrower and thinner than last\nseason, while the liisb military heel\nhas been replaced with one flatter and\nnot more than 1 Inch high.

With\ndinner clothes, however, dull pumps\nare coming into favor. For afternoon\nfunctions dull leather shoes with col\nored tops are both popular and proper.\nThis pertains more to black leather\nthan to the tans.\nGreat variety Is shown in sports\nmen's shoes; a popular one is made\nof horse hide, with double soles and\nGoodyear welt For \"tramping\" and\ngeneral country wear a shoe that will\nundoubtedly meet with high favor this\nfnll Is of heavy Russian calf, with\nscafe.Eole and heel.

Sept. 16. There Is a very\ngeneral satisfaction among racing men\nthat the Jockey club has entirely exon\nerated Danny Mahcr. the great American\nJockey, from the. charge that he had not\nproperly ridden Sallust at tho Leicester\nmeeting.\nMahcr has gained a place for himself\nsecond to no Jockey in the history of the\nBritish turf. Ills 7nodesty and all-around\ncleverness has made him very popular,\nand tlje charge that ho had ridden a\nsuspicious raco came as a complete\nshock. His exoneration is generally com\nmended. In writing of the affair ''Spear\nmint,\" one of tho leading sporting writers\nIn England.- says:\n\"In ono way the suspension of Danny\nMahcr by the Leicester executive and his\nsubsequent vindication by the stewards of\nthe Jockey club has served a moBt use\nful purpose. Jt has completely and ef\nfectually silenced the tongues of the\nscandal-mongers. Tn tho domain of\nracing, as everywhere else In this funny\nold world, thcro abound persons of such\nstrange mental constitution that they\nmust forever be. thinking evil of their\nfellow beings. It Is scarcely credible, but\nIt Is nevertheless true that, because Ma\nher has had a long run of bad luck, many\npooplo havo concluded that to put It\nmildly he has not boon doing his best.\nSince the Leicester Incident f have had\nscores of letters on the. subject of Ma\nher's riding, and, having destroyed thorn\nall as soon as read, I cannot recall th-at\none of them was complimentarj- to the\nAmerican Jockey, The foundations of\ngreatness were over treacherous.\nMaher Is VIndicatod.\n\"To my way of thinking. Maher has\nbeen olie of tho greatest benefactors that\nthe British turf has ever' had. Not onlv\nhas he adorned and embellished it by his\ngenius aF a horseman, but by his mod\nest, unassuming conduct he has earned\nthe .respect and admiration cf every man\nof standing and influence connected with\ntho sport. ThOHe who suggest that\nMahcr Is not ridng as he ought to do\nbelong to that vpnomoualy ignorant class\nwhich is fprever seoking for sinister mo\ntives where none are to be found. Mahcr\nhas hecii vindicated by the highest tri\nbunal of 'Justice known to tho snort.\nWhy. then, 'should the groundlings con\ntinue to snarl and grumble? Watch how\nthey will change their tune If Maher\nshould haopen suddenly upon a streak\nof luck. To the little American I offer\nmy heartiest congratulations on having\nemerged hf triumphantly from such a\ntrying ordeal. He was at most tho vic\ntim of a regrettable misunderstanding.\n\"It Is a. nity that the artlHtry of Maher\nIs not more common among one jockevn\nI recently referred to a case of the\nbutcher-boy tyne of riding which or\ncurrod at one of our south coast meet\nings. Sipce then I have learned from a\ntrainer friend that tho animal conocrncu\na most valuable and promising one\nwas so badly cut about the head and\nface, especially near the oyrs, that it\nwas at one time thought that It had\nbeon permanently damaged. Since Its\nreturn to Its training auarters It ha\nbeen ho nervous and out of sorts that it\nhas had to have veterinary treatment.\nSurely this is the sort of riding thn\nstewards could deteet nnd ounish with\nout any difficulty. 1 am quite convinced\nthat, much valuable blood stock is\nruined each year by the stunldly crul\nriding of some of our horsemen. The\nJockeys fond of the whin are well known.\nLet them be Tratched and their Daeslon\nfor excessive Diinlshment rigorously sup\npressed.\" Joluison Fight Probably Off,\nThere Is a. suspicion that the. J'ohnson\nWells fight will not be fought. I hear\nthat the' ngro champion not only is not\nIn condition now, but Is doing very little\nto get In condition. Wells, on thft other\nhand, not only is trained to tho minute,\nbut shows auch marked Improvement\nthat he will not be an oasy mark for the\nbig, darkey if he Is badly out of ehape.\nAs a. defeat at the hands of Wells would\nprobably cancel his arrangements with\nMcintosh, which are worth more than he\ncan possibly make out. of the WcDb fight,\nit would cause no surprise here among\nthose who know If .lohnnon should bo\nreputed too sick to meet the engagement.\nTWO OF UTAH'S GRIDIRON\nD. BE1TNION. SAM OLSEN.\nTho church agitation against, the fight\nand pictures may be only a part of John\nson's good luck. Tho bout will probably\nbe called off.\nLord Marcus Beresford, who lias su\npreme management of King Goorge's\nstud, is like all the Waterford family,\nfull of high spirits. There is hut one per\nson entitled to .drive down Rotten Row,\ntho duke of St. Albans, and it is doubt\nful if ever he cares to exorcise the privi\nlege. \"But Lord Marcus bet ho would do\nIt in broad . daylight and without inter\nference. The wager was accented and\n(he time fixed for the adventure about\nnoon All Lord Marcus's friends cam\ntrooping along to see him. but time went\non, and nothing could be seen of tho\nsportsman. By and by a watering cart\ncame along-, driven by the usual water\nman in a smock. As the car passed,\nalong leisurely the driver smiled, arid on\ncloser observation Lord Marcus's friends\nrecognized the winner of, the wager. A\ncourtier and a sportsman, ho has a host\nof friends. Like her husband, Lady Mar\ncus, who was Miss Ridley, is fond of\nhorses and racing, and is seen at all the\nsmart race meetings.\nThere is no truth In the announcement\nwhich has bepn sent all round the press,\nthat the king has ordered a new racing\nyacht to be built for him, which Is\" to\nbe completed and ready for sea in the\nspring. It would really be interesting to\nlearn how' all these fictions originate. The\nkljig has no Intention of either building\nor buying another yacht, and thcro Is no'\nprospect of his taking \"an active part in\nyacht racing.' It was only the other\nday that it was stated that the king had\n\"made over\" King Edward's racing cut\nter Britannia to tho prince of Wales. His\nmajesty's participation, in yacht racing\nwill be limited to the Cowes regatta i\nweek.\nFew Distance Horses.\nEnglish turf authorities are trying to\nfind a reason for the acknowledged scar\ncity of staying or distance performers on\nthe British training grounds, \"Augur.\"\nin the Sporttng Life, says: \"The truth\nof the matter would seem to bp. that\npractically all the interest onco taken in\nlong-distance racing Is now non-existent,\nor, at any rato, rapidly Is becoming\nso. Nowadays everything Is sacrificed to\nspeed. Personally 1 think the stamina\nof our thoroughbreds has deteriorated of\nlate years, and this opinion Is unreserv\nedly shared by more than one \"veteran\nracegoer whom I have consulted.\"\ni He regretfully comments on tho decline\nof tho Chester cup. and tho Northumber\nland plate, the Godwood plate, and every\nother long-distance handicap excepting\nthe Cosarcwltch. and adds:\n\"The present state of affairs could be\nreadily bettered, but the methods I\nrecommend are. I fear, far too drastic\nto possess any chanco of over getting\nbeyond the stage of discussion\". I would\nabsolutely abolish all two-year-old rac-'\nIng except In September. Odlober and\nNovember; do away with selling plates\nof whatever kind or description; make\nthe nilnnium distance of every race a\nnillo, except in the caso of two-year-bids,\nand insist that every programme\nshould Include at least two races per day\nof two miles or over. There Is nothing\nparticularly original about these sugges\ntions, for they obtain in France to a\nmodified degree.\nIn that country there are no two-year-old\nraces until August, and horses three\nyears old and over rarely run less than\na mile. A typical day's racing at\nChantilly on a Sunday in May was one\nto five events, the distances of which\nwero one mile and lhrtp. furlongs, two\nmiles and a half, one ,mllc and a quar\nter, one mile and a half and one mile\nand a quarter.\n\"U\" FOOTBALL TEAM\nIS STRENGTHENED\nCoach Bennion's football squad, which\nhas been practicing for the last two\nweeks, had Its last workout yesterday\nprior to the opening of the school work.\nThe squad has beep small up to tho\npresent time, but with the close of regis\ntration more of the fe!low3 arc expected\nto show up.\nLast night three of the men on whom\nBennion places a lot of hope were seen In\nharness on Cummlugs field.

Thi3 can be\neasily done at any garage, and occa\nsional use of the decarbonizing attach\nment of the speedo will easily and\nquickly remove all carbon, residue. The\nppoe\"do will also increase tho power of\nthe motor and effect a saving of gnso\nline, as it breaks, up under spray each\nparticle 'of .gas after leaving the car\nburetor and injects additional air automatically.\nPLEASED TOURISTS\nUSE MAPSAND LOGS\nMissouri Man Shown That\nE-M-F Pathfinder Is Do\n. nig Good Work.\nThat The Tribune autoiriobilc, routes\nare rapidly becoming ncceptcd as dfii\ntfial, is shown ' by Ihe constantly in\ncreasing demand for back numbers of\ntho papers containing these- maps and\nroutes.

Shortly\nafterward Miss llarncd and her companion rented a\nlittle brown house on the .banks of the Truckcc River,\nwhere they passed the remainder of their stay in the\ntown.\nArundel Smith, pretty and \"deucedly English, ,\ndon't y'know,-'' went there nil the way from\n\"India's coral strand'7 for the improvement of her\nmatrimonial health. The son of an English brewor re\npented of a too hasty alliance with a music hall artist\nand hit the trail for. Reno to seek roniission of his sin.\nHe soon met his heart's desire in the person of an\nAnglicized American matrou, but it was ouby a few\nweeks before she, too, had arrived in the haven of\nrestless ones begging balm for her broken heart. Mrs.\nElsie A. Harrison, a beautiful woman and talented\nartist, appeared there one day for the purpose of rec\ntifying a foolish elopement comraittod at. the romantic\nago of sixteen. Reno has an international reputation\nas a health resort for matrimonial breakdowns. '\nNOT all the members of the divorce colouy are from\nthe \"400\" or the stage. Moro thau'half prob\nably are working their way. They come from the mass\nof American people aud enter at once into the business\nlife of the towu. Stenographers, dressmakers, laun\ndresses, telepbono operators, waitresses, manicurists\nand hairdrcssere, any trade or profession you may think\nof, they are all thero for the same purpose. Jt. is -a\nnever ending procession. They come and go, followed\nby another consignment to fill in the vacant places.\nJt is not an unusual thing for a member of the colouy\nto enter a. shop and ask for her favorite sales-lady,\nonly to find her gone, Jf she asks what has become\nof her, the answer is always the same.\n\"Wiry, don't you know? She got hers last Wednes\nday, and she declared sho y couldu 't stay another\nminute. I thought you knew that her time was about\n.up,\"\nThe men are a little more stealthy in their comings\nand goings than tbo women. They sneak into town\novernight, buy up a business from some departing\nbrother, change the name on the window and start in\nwhere bo left off. Probably your favorite cigar store\nis owned by a candidate) for divorce, who hires similar\nliberty seekers as his clerks. Lawyers who have beeu\nprominent in the East rent, offices on a eix-monih\nlease, hang out their shingles, and represent a hundred\nanxious clients before their owu cases are called. You'\njust get accustomed to your waiter at the hotel when\nhe \"gets his\" and leaves for parts unknown.\n\"With the men employment is au Import ant factor\n.in establishing a residence, and their frantic searches\nfor something that can be called employment furnish\ngreat amusement for tho colony. Chauffeurs and waiters\nhave an easy timo finding something to do, for they\narc greatly in demand, but hundreds are obliged- to\ntake what they can got. Tho wealthy president of an\nEastern bank worked as a chauffeur during his entire\nstay. Up. was known to his employers as \"George.\"\nA druggist from Illinois became a bartender iu one of\nthe best appointed saloons in the main street. A. silver\ntongued minister of the \"gospel went to work in the\nfreight yards of the Southern Pacific. Railroad. The\nclerk who sells you your socks may be a millionaire\nin disguise, and the delivery boy of your favorite gro\ncery may be a doctor or an architect.\nAS a rule the floating citizens of Reno are very se\ncretive and questions are\" not popular. Inquis\nitive peoplo are snubbed as uot fit, persons to move\nin the best society. Many of the colonists do not want\n.the outside world to know where they are. Asa proof\nof this one has only to see the nighty parade to the\nSouthern Pacific station. Every evening there is a\nsteady procession of divorce candidates on its way to\nthe railroad mailbox. A railway postmark tolls no\ntales, and in this way the recipients of the epistles may\nbe left, completely in tho dark as to one's whereabouts.\nThis custom is known among the colonists as \"The\nConvict's Resort,\" and knowing smiles are exchanged\nwhen two conspirators meet at the mail box.\nIjast year when the census man arrived in Reno\npandemonium reigned for several days. lie was about\nas welcome a visitor to the seekers of freedom as a\nred rag to a herd of gentlemen kine. They considered\nhim altogether too inquisitive, and they cast about\nthem for some 'way iu which to evade him. The only\npersons who held 'authoritative positions iu the town\nwith whom they wore intimately acquainted were the\njudges who tried the divorce cases. So tho fair un\nknowns called upon Judges Orr and Pike.\nThey wanted to know if the good, kind judges\ncouldn't tell them some way to escape from the awful\ncensus enumerator, .but the Itiud judges frankly told\nthem that it was dangerous to trifle with the agents\nof Uncle Samuel and that tho best course was to stand\nright up and be counted. It. had another advantage\nalso, as it established residence of tho prospective lit\nigant beyond the shadow of doubt, and this ia a valu\nable assot when one goes divorcing.\nBut in spito of the ndvice of the judges, the census\nman did not havo easy sailing. When ho swooped down\non the .Colonial and Stewart apartmont houses he found\nt.hnt a gicat many of tho occupants were away on trips.\nCoachrrfeu and maids had suddenly become deaf aud\ndumb. Butlers and grocers, much to their own regret,\nhad never .learned the English laugunge. Even tho\nvery dogs in tho streots were muzzled. Tho census\nman was clearh' in a pdedicament. IIo wns persist\nent, however, and somotimes he caught his prey napping\nand gained admittance.\nAt such times ho would begin with tho usual ques\ntions about the name, age, color nnd ancostrnl history\nof the residents. Then he would move on to tho di\nvorce queries, and that's whore tho ombarrassing fea\nture came in. It is a bother to have to tell in detail\nabout ono's previous husbands and wives, cspecially\nwhen one may not hayo kept a notebook. JIow could\na woman .bo expected :to know the full name of her\nsecond or third husband when she was about to shed\nher tenth 1\nDespite the difficulties, however, the census man\nsucceeded in rounding up more than two hundred di\nvorced folks and put- their life stories down on. the\nblanks.\nnn HERE havo been many now romances born from\nthe ashe3 of tho old ones at Reno. The Httlo\ncity has acted as a sort of clearing house for the ro\nmating of the misfits. Their parties in the homes, the\ndances at the roadhouscs and the late parlies at the\ncafes have been responsible for awakening in the heart\nof many a man and woman a fire which thej had long\nthought extinguished. In spite of former protestations\nto' the contrary, they find themselves willing to try\nagain, hoping that this time it will \"take.\"\nAlice Johnson of New York met also- divorced\nAttorney-General Stoddard of Nevada at an cveningj\ngathering at Reno, and considered him interesting\nenough to marry, so they wcut to the judge who had\ngiven each of them their decrees and became one\nagain. Mrs. Freida Thaw Pctt, who had already made'\ntwo unsuccessful attempts to get a husband whom she\ncould put up with and who would stick, fell in love\nwith a young mining engineer who attended some of\nher entertainments, with the result that she is now\nMrs. Young and lives 4.\" a mining camp far away among\ntho mountains, and it is said that at' last she is\nhappy. Mrs. Henry Spies Kip also chose the simple\nlife for her last experiment. She has married a young\nmining superintendent and gone to live among the\n'snowy peaks of California. Tt. seems almost a repiti\ntion of tlio tales of Bret llartc.\nThere is tragedy, too, in tho chaos of Reno's\ndaily life. Many tender hearts are broken iu the very\noperation of mending others. There are plenty of hus\nbands and wives who really love and who Teali.c that\nthe differences between them and their spouses have\nbeen brought, about .by simple misunderstandings that\ncould b-reasily cleared up if the other would only listen\nto renson, but in the heat of tho moment he or she\nhas fled to Reno and that inexorable mill has ground\nout a decree of divorce before a settlement could bo\nmade.\nnpHEN, too, the most of the beauties who seek frcc-\ndom are pledged to another beforo they arrive\nin the Sagebrush State. They amuse themselves with\nthe youth of the town until the day comes when thc3'\nhave received tho little decree they have been waitiug\nfor so patiently Then they celebrate. The3' givo a\nwonderful dinner. The fair one is congratulated on '\nher coming marriage, which up to this time has not\nbeen mentioned aloud (it, isn't considered good form\nto do so), and joy reigns supreme.. But there is one\nsad heart among them, The bo' who has danced at\ntendance upon her during tho long wait does not. fcol\nhapp3'. He creeps home a little more cynical than ho\nwns beforo and considerably poorer. The society of\nthese beautiful and witty women has completely spoiled '\nhim for the simple village maiden whom he formerly\nadorqd. And yet he is not for them.\nThe lure of Reno 1ms boon felt throughout tho\nworld, and each day brings some one who wishes to\nrid himself of an impediment which ho acquired in\nyears gone by. Special trains are organized from time\nto time to carry matrimonial misfits to their haven of\nrest. It. is not so uncommon to find that ever' occupant\nof n particular Pullman car on tho Overland Limit od\nis bound for the divorce mill at Reno, Tho town has\nbeen well recommended by those who havo gninod\nfreedom within its borders.

U is a dirty quarter: the houses are old and\ndilapidated, and the -.hops are dark and gloomy. It is\nWi far fromv being an aristocratic street. But aristocracy.\nHH has entered its dreary confines more than once and\nHH all the inhabitants' are proud of the fact. Many times\nHH they have rushed to their doors as an emblazoned car-\njH ringe, drove by to see who the noble lady was that\nH was going to stop at M. Charabot's little boutique.\ntm Often they have stood by in open-mouthed awe as some\nHH actress, famous on the boulevards, has driven up to\nor'kr some of the pastrj cook's cakes for an evening\nH parly.

The Duchessc de Iton-\nH chart sent back the cherry tarts she had bought the\nH day before: She said they tasted of petroleum. M.\nfl Charabot turned pale. Pas possible! His cherry tarts\nH tasted of petroleum! It couldn't bo true. He had\nHH tnken especial pains with those tarts just because they\nIH were for the Duchesse, who had always been his favor\nite customer. It was his invariable rule to cive her\nH the best he had in his shop. He tried to laugh non\nchalantly, but his throat was t'oo dry. Then he went\ninto the back room and tasted one of the little pics'.\nB He detected nothing which resembled petroleum. Eyi-\nHl dently thri Duchcsae was merely in a bad humor. 1'cr-\nH baps tho Duke had stayed at his club too late the night\nHB before.\njH The thought made him feel easier. He laid the\nHp condemned pastries aside and selected fresh ones.

He was certain that\nHHH there was no petroleum in any form in the tarts. The\nHH Idea of accusing M.

Lucienne Breval had been sehed-\nHH uled to sing Carmen at the Opera Comique the night\nH before, but\" she had not done so on account of M.\nSH 1 Charabot's tarts. Mile. Breval lives in the Faubourg.\nH not so very far from his shop, and she oftcu sent in\n1HH for cakes and pastries. The cook remembered that she\njHfl had ordered a half-dozen cream tarts the previous day.\nIHflj U seems that the famous singerthought the tarts had\nHH n queer taste, but as her maid had been using benzine\nHHH during tbe afternoon she decided thnt it was due to the\nft i W:w- lt\nodor iu the air rather than 10 anything foreign in the\ntarts.\nShe went to the theatre that evening at her usuul\ntime, and while her maid was. dressing her she became\nconscious thai, a taste of benzine seemed to linger iu\nher mouth. When she wu-. ready to go on the stage\nshe decided to try a few scales in the secrecy of her owy\nI J ft' 'gsgxia\nI :\nMile. Marie Louise Derval\nroom to test the quality of her voice before she appeared\niu public. At first everything went well, but uh she\nrose higher i. seemed us if something were filling her\nthroat and choking her. Suddenly her voice broke. The\nsound almost stunned her. She had never heard any\nthing like it before in her life. She could not imagine\nwhat had caused it until she thought again of the ben-\n.inr. But why should that have choked when she was\nentirely away from it now? Ah, yes; there must bare\nbeen benzine in the tarts.\nIt was, of course, impossible for her to sing, and she\nlost no time in notifying the manager. Luckily Margue\nrile Carro was to be found, and she took tbe prima\ndonna's place. But the audience had to be kept waiting\nthrco-quafters of an hour, and all on account of M.\nCharabot'.s tarts. The next morning Mile. Breval sent\na messenger to the pastry cook to find out why he chose\nto flavor his tarts with benzine.\nWH10N M. Charabot beard of tbis fresh misfortune\nhe was in despair. This was not to be explained\non the score of bad humor. Mile. Breval's voice had\nbeen ruined, perhaps forever. The audience bad been\nkept waiting for almost an hour. There were too many\nhard and cold facts here to explain easily. Still he could\nnot believe that his tarta bad caused the trouble. He\nwas certain thnt he had nol put benzine or anything like\n; it in his dough or in the filling. There was none in the\nhouso that could have got In by mistake. He scratched\nhis bead thour'-ilfully and almost tremblingly.\nJust then a maid came running in and furiously\ndemanded what he meant by putting gnsolonc in bis\nbrioches to poison people. Her mistress. Mile. Louise\nDerval, who was playing at the Theatre des Capucincs.\nhad been made violently ill by eating the cakes she had\nbought there tin1 day before. They were actually fat\n11 rated with the horrible stuff, the maid declared. She\nsuggested that he stop trying to poison people and begin\nselling cakes that were fit to eat. M Charabot, who\nhad hitherto beard nothing but praise of bis pastries,\nwas scandalized at bearing thorn vilified in such scath\ning terms. He saw that something must be done and\ndone quickly. But what? Pcrhnps all his patrons\nwould start: suit asainst him. If there was really any\npetroleum in hit; tarts he must get rid of them as soon\nas possible. They would be terrible evidence against\nhim if they were found.\nHe went to the window and picked up a luscious\nplum tarl and tasted it. He could see nothing the mat\nter with it, IIo was about to take a second bite when\nho heard 11 sardonic laugh behind him. lie turned nnd\nsaw one of his Infuriated patrons standing in the door\nway with an eclair in his hand.\n\"I'm glad you can eat the things you cook.\" he said.\n\"Nobody else can.

They were Union soldiers pris\noners of war.

They were merely the pre\ncursors of tho fearful night\" through which we wero\n'compelled to pass. As wc dashed into the swamp,\nveiled with Cimmerian darkness, wc encountered\ncnr.ger from falling branches and uprooted trees.\nWhile the storm was a huge terror it was nothing\ncompared with the dread we had for those whose\nexcited voices we could hear on the edge of the\nswamp men who wero seeking our recapture.\n\"We could find no ground on which to tread, no spot\nto rcJclinc upon owing to the depth of water and\nmire, into which we sank.

They gave chase, but wo succeeded in elud\ning them by making our way into nn almost impene\ntrable swamp, closo at hand. Hideous serpents of\nvarious kinds compelled us to seek safety on tho trunk\nof a hugo pine tree, prostrated long since by ago and\ninfirmity. Wo had considerable difficulty, after the\nsun went down, in getting out of the swamp, but wo\nforgot somo of our tribulations on discovering a bed\nof sweet potatoes, to which wo helped ourselves.\nBefore tho lapse of a week wo met with a great mis\nfortune in tho loss of our cooking utensils, including\nknives spoons, towel and several boxes of matches.\nThe rations with which wc had provided ourselves\nbefore starting having given out, we sought sustenance\nin tho cornfields and swamps, and early one morning\nwero enjoying a feast in the woods skirting a sweet\nipotato patch when a party of horsemen dashed fu\nriously toward us. We had not anticipated danger in\nso lonely and secluded a spot and were perhaps a little\ncareless in our movements. But self-preservation be\ning the first law of nature, and having no weapons of\ndefense, wc sprang instinctively to our foot and ran\nin an opposite direction, leaving all our valuables\nnecessities they were behind. ,\nThe ever growing question of subsistence at length\nbecame so desperate thai it looked as if wc should bo\ndriven to seek food at the houses of tho planters, a pro\nceeding we' had solemnly pledged ourselves not to\ndo under any circumstances, owing to tho danger, at\ntending it. \"For several days we'wandercd along tho\noutskirts of fields, diligently seeking corn and beans,\nand occasionally finding a stray car which, spurred by\nn ravenous appetite, wc managed to masticate, the\nprocess nearly breaking our teeth.\nWo had a remarkable adventure at tho midnight\nhour near Dallas, N.

Breathless frorn, a long chaso\nby a dozen horsemen wc halted in a dense wood to\ncgain strength, and while thus engaged heard a man\nand woman approaching, both singing from the doptli\nof thoir lungs. Taking it for granted they woro\nnegroes wo concluded to invite their4 assistance, and\nwhen the couple renched us we stopped them. Tho\nwoman, with a yell of terror, ran off like a frightened\ndeer, while the man, in a \"voice that betrayed no\nnervousness, asked who we wore. His challcngo\nsatisfied us he was a white man, and the click of a\npistol gave evidence of his ability to defend himself.\nNecessarily, wo resorted io conventional strategy,\nputting and answering questions with tho utmost\nwariness, all tho time wishing wc had allowed him\nto pass unchallenged. Tt required but a brief time,\nhowever, to discover the status of the stranger, ' and\nprobablv he had never been embraced before with the\nvehement warmth wc displayed on discovering ho\nwas a loyalist, a firm friend of tho American union,\nlie insisted upon our visiting his home, two miles\nnway, which wc did by following a path in the woods,\nthus\" avoiding mounted pntrols, which continually\nscoured the country.\nHis amiable wife, who had awaited his return from\ntown, speedily proparcd an excellent supper, the first\nsquare meal wc had had in six months, to which wo\ndid the fullest justicethe smiles and k ndly words of\nour hostess seasoning the rich repast, t night, sit\nflng beforo a cheerful blaze of that noble North Uiro\nlbiian's great hearth, he told us the story of tho\nlovnlty of tho people in the western section ot the\nstate,\" proving to us that freedom still had bravo de\nfenders among tho hardy foresters of the -Old North\nState.\"\nWhen the rising sun. dazzling and radiant, shot sud\ndenly golden beams of light wo were several nines\nbeyond Dallas, our bravo nnd gcnial host, 0.

Long beforo wo reached the ma\nicstic Catawba river, in North Carolina, r was com\npelled to walk barefooted; and, much as I suffered, it\nwas no comparison to what I underwon't after reach\ning the mountains. While making our weary way\nthrough a pine woods and endeavoring to give a wide\nhorf.h to the town of Morgnnlon, a rendezvous for\nConfederate conscripts, we wero almost paralyzed on\ndiscovering a few yards away, and directly in our\nourso, a splendid looking Confederate officer mounted\nupon a fine horse. In his holster wero a brace of\npistols and at his sido dangled a well worn saber.\nTietrcnt on our part would have been useless, and wo\ninstinctively halted as the -horseman stood before us\nwith sympathy depicted in his every look Ho asked\nno questions, apparently understanding our desires.\n3 i roc led us to the best point for crossing tho Catawba\nriver, whoso angry roar we could plainly hear, and\nputting spurs to tho noble animal lie gracefully be\nstrode dashed away. How our hearts went out to\n'that .gallant soldier as we resumed our tramp! Two\nhours later, wo stood upon a high bluff overlooking a\nrushing stream which roquired two days' time to\ncross.\nThis speedily brought us into Caldwell county,\n. whero wo providentially met many deserters from\ntho Confederate armies men -who were impressed or\ndriven into a service which they had condemned\nfrom the start. These brave men, headed by tho nu\nmerous Estes family, welcomed us with open arms.\nWo had but little difficulty in persuading a hundred\nand more of these loyal North Carolinians to accom\npany us to tho Union lines, reaching which wo\npromised to use our best influence in procuring them\narms and clothing, and with but little hesitation they\nbado their wives and little ones farewell mid started\non a long journoy across the highest mountains cast\nof the Rockies.\nA fatiguing march of two days brought us lo tho\nsummit of Grandfather mountain, on which lived the\nfamily of a Baptist clergyman named Prickott.

Mrs. Prickott regretted she had no meat\nwith which lo regalo us, but shortly after \"Sim\"\nPhilyaw, a noted Union scout, arrived with a young\n.black bear ho had killed noar tho old sawmill below.\nDuring the night a violent snowstorm sot in, and\nwhoa day appeared tho ground was covered with\nfleecy flakes to the depth of six or soven inches. My\nthcart almost failed as I remeraborcd that'I was with\nout covering for my lacerated and bruised foot, my\nboots having long since become useless; that I had no\nhat;- that my thin bluo blouse was in tatters; that my\nred flannol shirt, which I had worn more thau six\nmonths without change, was threadbare, and thac\nmy trousers scarcely reached to my Knees owin to\nhard usage.

I\nhave rarely met a man so aptly cast\nfor his part as this Captain Shclton.\nHe was tall, somewhat unevenly, fat\ntened, clothed in light, worsted, with a\nstyle of coat, provincialVy called \"cutaway,'-'\nalways kept buttoned, a lop\nhat and very shiny patent, leather?.\nHis. eyes were alert, and his spocch\nrapid and persuasive.

He had struck a hard\nplace in trade. If he could get over it.\nhis fortune was established.\nThe captain seemed an ideal pro\nmotor. He strove, with no slight cun\nning, to inform himself through me\nabout Randolph Mason. He led to hi?\nqueries always .by two roads, like a\ncommander of infantry; when ono\nwas found guarded, he crossed quickly\nlo tho other I think, too, that his\nknowledge of men was fairly accurate,\nfor, when he cnu presently, before\nRandolph Mason himself, his manner\nperceptibly changed, the \"hail fellow\"\nvanished, he stated his business with\na certain approach to dignity, and it\nwas only when the \"murder.\" so lo\nspeak, was out, that the real man came\nvisibly to the surface.\nRandolph Mason gave I ho Ponnsyl\nvaninn close alention. He led him\nalmost persuasively into detail. He\nunearthed here and there a covered\nportion of his story until the nature\nof the affnir came wholly into day\nlight. Tho art of subtle' inmiiry, in\nthe use of which' Shelton had a certain\nskill, was turned masterfully against\nhim, and so unobtrusively that each\nelicited feature seemed to follow\nsomo voluntary statement, like un in\nevitable sequel.\nCaptain Shell on had intended to\ngive such elements of his story as he\ndeemed necessary to his ond; but under\nhis handling \"by Randolph Mason,\nhe was unable to stop at his own\nmarked points.

He exhibited a map\nshowing in red this strip of land run\nning across the parallelogram, and cs\nplained that the oil-bearing rocks in\nthis region sloped on either tide, form\ning a j-ynclinal. and that this synclinal\nlay almost wholly within the tract col'\norcd red on the map. T.t vas therefore,\nthe storehouse of the whole region.\n\"Now the difficulty was that these hvo\nmen had an agreement that, one would\nnot sell without the other. 'Each de\nmanded the same price for his propcrtv,\none hundred thousand dollars in cash.\nThe tract lying over the synclinal was\nworth half a million dollars, the other\nwas worthless. Captain Shclton could,\nof course, purchase both, but he did not\nhava the a'mount. He had in available\ncash on deposit, about oighty thousand\ndollars. Ho could not get another dol\nlar. He had labored for years, he said,\nto locate this eldorado. He had found\nit at litsl. like a pot of gold at the end\nof the rainbow. Xly right of discovery\nit belonged to him; he had earned it\nwith his wits; he wished now to pos\nsess it.\nSuch were the well-pruned facts that\nCaptain .Shclton had selected for pre\nsentation to Randolph Itfason; but the\nnarrative, under Mason's touches, would\nno), stop with, two directors of a eon:\nscrvntive savings bank in Now England\nholding tracts of oil land in a distant\nstnte remaining unexplained; it would\nnot stop with a mysterious pact binding\nthem to a common price; it would not\nstop at eighty thousand dollars clean\ncash in Sholton's hand unaccompanied\nby any avenues of credit. The parts\nof the'story could not be separated\nwithout disclosing glaring discrepancies.\nWherever the narrative was cut. it bled.\nTn his effort to avoid this obvious re\nsult, the man said more than ho in\ntended and in the- end told everything\n\"that he had meant to conceal. If the\nnaked facts first given by Captain Shcl\nton were commonplace, this pirate's\nlog from which they were taken was\nnot. Cast into proper sequence this was\nthe wholo storv:\nCaptain Shclton was a financial buc\ncaneer. Some two years earlier. In a\ngusl of fortune, his brig had sunk and\nhe had come, with flvo hundred dollars,\nperilously ashore. Faced with :i. despor\nale need for n. now sloop, ho hit finally\nupon this dolpclabln plan. The country\nat lorgc was In a hysteria of Industrial\ncombination!', the markets sorged with\nsecurities, and the hanks necessarily\nshort, of ready money. He went to tho\npresident of tho Driller s Bank of Pitts\nburg and offered to sccuro for It a mil\nlion of dollars In non -Interest-bearing de\nposits, guaranteed to remain undisturbed\nIn the possession of the bunk for at least\nono year, provided the bank would pay\nhim I! per cent per annum for the de\nposit. This was 1 per cent less than\nbanks generally were paying for time\ndeposits running no longer than four or\nsix months.\nTho president at once agreed, and. pre\nsuming that It was Shcllon's Intention\nto canvass for deposits, loaded him with\nliterature of the bank. The excellent\ncaptain dropped theso pamphlets Into tho\nwaste basket and walked over lo a cheap\nlodging on Fourth avenue. There, from\na drunken roustabout, for a bundled dol\nlars, ho bought a. bagful of oil leases on\nworthless territory lying nlong tho east\nside of the Ohio river above St. Mary's;\nThen ho got a charter from the secre\ntary of state of West Virginia, and or\nganized tho Hnion Consolidated Oil com\npany with a capital of five millions.\nFor two dollars and fifty cents he bought\na seal, and for five more a book of stock\ncotrificatcs excellently printed on bank\nnot'1 paper.\nThen the captain sat down at a hotel\njdi-ck In the city of Pittsburg and wrote\nMho literature which had come to mc In\ntho mall two yours before.\nThis he put In the hands of a mailing\nlist agency of Now l'Jngland with a de\nposit on account of two hundred dollars.\nWith tho remaining money he rented\nIhroc furnished rooms?, on Ihe nineteenth\nfloor of. tho Iron building, and sat down\n: lo await tho arrival of his fortune.\n1 The president of the Driller's bank\nsent for Captain Shelton and demanded\n, an explanation ot his rcmurkablc plan,\ni The captain instnntly invited nn Inspou-\nI Ion .of the company, lie exhibited re\ncorded leases, legally valid, covering\nI some 10.000 acres of land, nnd a corpor-\nalien properly organized, the lease holds\ntransferred In payment of the stock\n'even' detail entirely within the law. He\n'pointed out that under his plan no man\nI could lose a dollar of his money. It\n.would remain on deposit with tho bank\nto the depositor's credit while he, Shcl\nI ton. tested tlm territory. If those lands\nJ proved oil-producing, as he thought thoy\nI would, then his stockholders Would make\nenormous profits. If they proved worth\nless, no man would lose a cent, the com-\npuny would be dissolved, tlio certificates\ncanceled and every stockholder permitted\nled to withdraw his deposit. Then he\n.spoke thus pointedly\n\"Your bunk's good, isuft It? You will\n1 pay the people's money back to them,\nI won't you? 1 can't rob them, and 1 nup\nI pose you won't.\"\nTho president of the Driller's bank\ndetermined to lay the matter before his\ndirectors. In the meantime, a tide of\nsmall deposits began lo arrive. When\nthe directors met on the second Tues\nday of the month, there were a hun\ndred thousand dollars In those depoalts,\nIncreasing with every mall. The bank\nneed!d the money. It was loaded with in\ndustrial Foourltlcs. The directors hesi\ntated, and finally continued tho matter\ni until the next meeting. Tim tide swelled\ninto n Hood, the' matter never camo up\nagain beforo the bnni'd. and Captain\nShelton secured not one million, us ho\nhad promised, but in all nearly two mil\nlion dollars In deposits.\nThe entrance of the two banlc direc\ntors from Massachusetts followed a Ut\nile later on. Shclton had sent his litera\nture broadly scattered into New lOngland.\nreaching for persons there with smull\nannuities and little- aovings In banks.\nIlls plan touched the very king bolt In\ntho nature of these people, a possibility\nof wealth without risk. The Income\nfrom their deposits in savings bunks was\nslight. This speculation Involved only\nthe transfer of deposits to a different\nbank with a try at an eldorado for a\nrider. Having determined that tho\nDriller's bank of Pittsburg was solvent,\ndeposits wont flooding westward. So\ngreat were the withdrawals that two di\nrectors of one of these banks in Massa\nchusetts, at tho suggestion of tho de\npositors, wont to Pittsburg to look into\ntho matter.\nCaptain Shclton was advised. Mc met\nB these gentlemen at the Pennsylvania sta\nt Hon. 'entertained them at the beet\nhostelry, directed their attention to tlm\nstability of tho Driller's bank, and then\nH carried tham down Into tho oil flold.\n3 There they found blindfolded fortune\nQ scattering her favors like n tipsy vus\nH tral. That man who whisked by the\nI train window in a motor from French\nshops had been, yesterday, a barber,\nThat man whose carriage waited at the\nI depot, with H driver In livery and a pair\n1 of cobs harnessed with sliver bucklon.\nI two years beforo hod waded the river\n1 from Ohio wet to his middle. That man\ni whose stone hounc clung to a bluff above\ni\nthe car track, apelng the architecture of\nthe Rhine, had found, not the lamp of\nAladdin, but that which Illuminated all\nlamps. The Prince of Monaco never\ndreamed of such an orgy of chance.\nCaptain Shelton counted well upon his\nhcadv air. He brought forth his maps,\nbut \"he spoke little and sanely. The\ntotpsv-turvv condition spoke for him. lie.\npoEcd an one sobor. careful, fnr-sshtod\nIn a community of drunkards. Hero were\nopportunities to be seized, wisely held\nin hand end made lo produce, not a cas\nual pot of gdld. ..but great fortune\nlasting for a century. He brought shrewd\nly to ihc strangers' notice ihe two tracts\nlying within his parallelogram of leased\nterritory. Thev instantly inquired why\nthese tracts were not Included, and he re\nplied that at the Mine the company\nleases vere taken they could not be bad,\nand now he could not secure thctn with\nout, the consent of Ihe stockholders, a\nthing Impr.ictlcnble. He would take these\ntwo' Oracts in his own name, but such\nan act might subject hlni lo criticism.\nThis was, of course, a lie. Tho roustn\nbout from whom Shclton had secured his\nleases omitted these tracts bocause tho\nowners demnnded 25 cents an ncre bonus.\nAround theso two tracts Shclton masked\nhis arts of suggestion. lie wished those\nmen's fingers dipped with his in the dish,\na little of their gold on. tho table, a\nwager left hero behind them on the spin\nof the wheel.\nWhop the two bank directors returned\nto New England, they took with them\nthe fee simple titles of these two tracts.\nTlioy took with thorn also the Impres\nsion\", but not the certainty, that Cap\ntain Shclton was merely au adventurer.\nAble to Judge accurately any situation\nIn Now England, they were at sea hero.\nThe bank- In Pittsburg wus certainly sol\nvent. The territory advertised by Shelton\nwas certalnlv covored by his leases. It\nwas a. land where Fortunatns drunk was\nswinging his purse by tho strings. Who\ncould say upon what passer the gold\nwould fall!\nF.lghteen months later, the Union Con\nsolidated Oil company was dissolved and\nits slock canceled. The bank returned\nthe deposits and paid Roger Shclton 58000\nIn interest. He feared to place this mon\ney in bank lest some one suing him might\nattach it. and kept it in a safety de\nposit box of a New York trust company.\nMe hud learned that the two bank direc\ntors were now in New York, and had\nhurried horo hoping to purchase tho tract\nof land he wished; but, on reflection, he\nhesitated to approach thorn, They would\nbo greatly suspicious of him. and he\nwould not risk having the deed taken in\ntho name of anv other person. He de\nsired to get hold of tho tract lying over\nthe synclinal, ond bo would, if necessary,\ngive nil the money be had for it. This\nwas tho story skillfully unmasked by\nRandolph Mason.\nThe captain, when tho cat was out. be\ngan to regret his rashness. Ills secret\nhad escaped him; it was an Indiscretion\nto bo amended by greater caution. He\nwas taken swiftly with a trembling seiz\nure of suspicions.\n\"You have overlooked tho names of\nthese gentlemen from Massachusetts,\"\nsaid Randolph Mason.\nA certain cunning dodged along Cap\ntain Shoiton's featuros. .\n\"I have not overlooked it.\" he replied.\n\"I don't intend to tell them. I expect\nmy regular lawyer to bo present when\ntheso men aro hoch. I camo to you for\na plan. When I get that, my lawyer\nwill do the rest. I don't mean tbeim\nYankees to sloop on tho trade. The doeds\nand the cash will go on tho tabic to\ngether. When they aro exchanged, tho\nmatter will he ended.- That's my way\nof doing buslnees. Now, what's your\nplan?\"\n\"My plan,\" said Mason, \"will conform\nto your way of doing business. Have\ntheso men here at 2 o'clock. I .el them\nknow nothing of the object of this con\nference. Hut you, on your part, take\nevery precaution. Come a holf hour\nearlier with your attorney. Bring the\ndoeds and the cash with you. Bring also\na notary. \"T would havo you tako no\nchance. I would have you omit, no safe\nguard which your instincts suggest.\"\nCaptain Shclton was greatly reassured;\nbut a doubt remained.\n\"If I come, they won't sell.\" ho said.\n\"That's the very trouble I'm trying lo\nget around,\"\n\"I will get around that,\" replied Ran\ndolph Mason.\n\"Then.\" said Captain Shelton. \"you\nwill have to pretend to represent some\none else, and leave mo to my lawyer.\"\n\"Your foresight is amazing;\" replied\nMason. \"1 shall leave you entirely to\nyour lawyer. I shall pretend to repre\nsent, let ns say. the stockholders of the\nUnion Consolidated Oil company.\"\n\"Good!\" cried the captain,\" \"that He\nwill do tho work!\"\nRandolph Mason arose and waited for\nhis visitor to depart.\n\"J think.\" he remarked, \"lhat It will\ndo tho work excellently.\"\nThe men who met in Randolph Ma\nson's private office were of most In\ncongruous types. My visual memory of\nthis conference remains clear-cut. like\nthe ollnuix of somo drama; there was the\nnotary, a tired old man, looking on un\nconcerned from a chair by the door;\nCaptain Shclton his under Iln painfully\ntightened, seated on ono side of the\nlibrary table with his attorney at his\nelbow. This nttornoy merits a word of\ncomment; lie was Ihe ablest praclllloner\nof his class In New York, a class aban\ndoned wholly to Intrigue, schooled srnal\ntcrlngly In tho law ihrouch attendance\nand experience at trials, but past masters\nof trickery; he wsm a little, rotund man.\nbald, with a fritiKO of hair running from\nthe top of ono ear around to the other:\na face as expressionless as wood: eves\nsteady as though set In by an optician.\nThe man's hands nlonc hot raved his\nthoughts they were ns nimble as the\nfore paws of a mink. Opposite wuro the\ntwo New Euglandcrs. an undo and his\nnenhow -tho elder, tall, trave. somber;\nthe vounuer. a youth, powerfully built,\nhis face fresh with health, his hands sug\ngesting tlic strength of ivory and Ran\ndolph Mason, walking up and down by the\nbookcases.\nMason introduced the matter with this\nremarkable statement to tho mcn from\nMassachusetts: He represented certain\nof the stockholders of tho Union Con\nsolidated Oil company, uctlncr for the\nbenefit of all. Tho stockholders of that\ncompany had IohI in interest on ineir\ndeposits, through Captain Rocer Shelton.\nsome\" 580 000, This money Captain Shel\nton was now ready to return. Ho wished\nto do so through these directors, lcnvlng\nthem to distribute It In detail to tho\nstockholders. However. In the manner of\nthis restitution. Captain Shclton wished\nto avoid ihe appearance of compounding\na fraud. Mason had. therefore, called\nthis meeting to propose that those two\ndirectors sell thor tracts of worthlesr\noil territory to Captain Shelton In consid\neration of this money and. after deduct\ning I heir Individual cxnondltures. refund\nthe balance of it lo tho various stock\nholders of the Union Consolidated Oil\ncompany. , . . ,\nThe two bunk directors, who had been\nuntil now greatly mystified, agreed In\nstantly to this proposition, the older\nspeaking for the other. They considered\ntheir investmont In this oil territory some\nwhat In the no.turc ot a trust, and hod\ndetermined to hold Ihc tracts.

They had gone to Pittsburg as\nenvovs. In a way. for the stockholders,\nand 'any gain arising from thai Jour\nney was equitably tho property of all.\nThey bad consequently asked one hundred\nthousand dollars In cash for each or\ntheso tracts, and had ugrood lo pool tho\ntwo properties, so that If oil woro ever\ndiscovered on cither tract, it would pay\nIn full the losses of the stockholders.

The next statement of Mason won\nstill further their amazed approval,\nHe ?ald thnt the two sales must bo\nunderstood to be compile and sepa\nrate transactions, concluded absolutely In\nevery detail upon tho signing of tho deed.\nand. in order that no claim could be\nafterward set up that In this sale Cap\ntain Shelton took advantage of any se\ncret knowledge of the value of cither ot\nthe two tracts, be suggested lhat Shcl\nton be permitted to select the tract which\nat this time he considered- he more val\nuable, in order that his opinion might bo\nknown beforo the doeds wore signed, pay\nfor it sovontv-nlno thousand dollars, and\ntako tho other tract at a nominal sum.\nsuv one thousand dollars. Then If cither\ntract should prove In the future to bo\noil producing. Captain Shelton could en\njoy that good fortune froe from any Im\nputation of deception in Its purchase.\nTho attorney's nlmblo fingers danced\non tho rungs of his chair this piece of\nstrategy was excellent. Shelton. too, in\nstantly saw its wisdom. If ho tool:, now,\ntho worthless tract at the large price,\nthe vcrv fact of this selection would con\ncluslcoly prove that when this worthless\ntract was purchased he knew nothing of\ntho fabulous value of the other. His\ngood faith, his Innocence of secret knowl\nedge, would bo hero and now Irrevocably\nestablished for all time to como. Thosw\nWho sold estates for pottage usually camo\ncrying to tho courtf, and if the deeds\nshowed on their faces that tho purchaser\nwas himself mistaken In tho value of\nthese estates, that cry would fall. Sepa\nrate, the two sales ought also to he, lhat\nno one other than tho signer of tho deed\ncould afterward claim nn attaching\nequity.\nThe two New ISnglandcrs assented to\nthis, nnd Captain Shelton Instantly se\nlected tho worthless tract- Tho attor\nney look two doods from his pocket and\nlaid them before him on tho tabic. Ho\nthen stated in detail the terms of the\npurchase; sevcnty-nlno thousand dollars\nIn cash for tho tract of twelve hundred\nacres, ono thousand dollars In cash for\nthe tract of nine hundred acres; the two\nsales distinct, separate transaction di\nrectly between tho parties named in the\ndeed. He wished this agreement clearly\nunderstood. The sentimental reason mov\ning Rogor Shclton to this purchase, as\ngiven bv Randolph Mason, was an ob\nservation beside tho point. . He nlono rep\nresented Roger Shelton. The purchaso of\nthese tracts was now a clcan-cul matter\nof business, showing wholly on the face\nof tlio deed. Then ho took up ono of the\ndeeds, wrote Into it the consideration,\nseventv-nlno thousand dollars, and hand\ned it to the younger man. who, it hap\npened, was tho owner of this tract. The\nlatter looked swiftly over tho deed and\nsigned II, the notary took his acknowl\nedgment, affixed tho seal and returned\nthe deed to tho attorney, who looked\nover It. and nodded to his client.\nCaptain Shclton sol his calfskin satchel\non the table, unlocked it with a brass\nkcv. look out a thousand dollars In one-hundrod-doliar\nbills and pushed the\nsatchel across the table.\n\"There's your money.' he said, and\nI throw In tho satchel.\".\nThe New EnglnndcV took the money IB\nout In packs, counted it and put It back; H\nthen he reached over on the table, took\nthe. brass key. locked the satchel, sot It m\ndown on the floor between his feet and S\ntucked tho key Into the pocket of his\nwaistcoat. The attorney put the cx-\ncutcd deed into his pocket, wroto the R\nconsideration of one thousand dollars\ninto tho other deed and pushed It, like-\nwise, across tho tabic. Tho elder Nov E\nKnglandcr spread out the deed bofora ffi\nhim and carefully road it. his forefinger\nmoving slowly along each line. When he II\ncame to tlic. end. he flxd his eye-glasnoK Mi\na little more securely to his nose, took 9!\nup a pen and dipped it Into the Ink-pot-\nAt this moment. Randolph Mason, stand- H\nIng behind him, leaned over swiftly. ml\npicked np the deed and tore It in two.\nInstantly Roger Shelton threw himself H\nncroa? the table, grabbing for the leather\nsatchel. The younger New Enslandcr. IS\namazed at this violent Incident, but in- Bi\nstinctlvely determined to protect the mon- n\noy now in bis possession at any coft. H\ngripped tho handle of tho satchol with m\nhis right nnd. rlslnc a little, struck tho W\nPonnsylvnniaii with\" the clenched fingers m\nof his loft.
